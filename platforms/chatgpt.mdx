## Interface Elements

### Button Locations

## How Memories Work in ChatGPT

### Memory Creation

ChatGPT creates memories when:
- You explicitly ask: "Remember that I prefer..."
- Important information is shared: project details, preferences
- The AI recognizes significant facts worth preserving

### Memory Format

Behind the scenes, memories are formatted as:
```
to=memoryplugin&&memory=[Your memory content here]
```

### Memory Context

When MemoryPlugin is active:
1. Existing memories are injected at conversation start
2. New memories are captured in real-time
3. Context persists across chat sessions
