  - Lower token usage and less clutter in long chats
  - Scales better as your memory collection grows

  #### How to use
  1) Add 30+ memories to a bucket  
  2) Click “Create Smart Categories” in the dashboard — see the [Smart Memory guide](/features/smart-memory)  
  3) Refresh categories anytime as your memories evolve

  #### Post‑release reliability
  Smoother processing for large collections with clearer progress feedback and fewer interruptions.
