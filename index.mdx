# Welcome to MemoryPlugin

MemoryPlugin solves AI "amnesia" by providing persistent, contextual memory across multiple AI platforms and conversations.

## Why MemoryPlugin?

Whether you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another AI tool, you're interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) that are fundamentally "stateless" - they can't learn or remember information between sessions. MemoryPlugin bridges this gap by creating a persistent memory layer that works across platforms.

## How It Works

MemoryPlugin performs two core functions:

1. **Store Memories** - Automatically or manually save important information from your AI conversations
2. **Supply Context** - Inject relevant memories into new conversations to provide context

This creates a seamless memory experience regardless of which AI assistant you're using at any given moment.
