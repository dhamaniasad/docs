MemoryPlugin solves AI "amnesia" by providing persistent, contextual memory across multiple AI platforms and conversations.

## Why MemoryPlugin?

Whether you're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another AI tool, you're interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) that are fundamentally "stateless" - they can't learn or remember information between sessions. MemoryPlugin bridges this gap by creating a persistent memory layer that works across platforms.

## How Does It Work?

MemoryPlugin acts as a persistent memory layer between you and your AI assistants. Here's the simple magic:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save Important Information">
    When you share something worth remembering, MemoryPlugin automatically stores it. You can also explicitly ask your AI to remember specific details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Memory Access">
    Your memories are injected into new conversations, giving your AI the full context it needs to provide personalized responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cross-Platform Sync">
    Information saved while using ChatGPT is instantly available when you switch to Claude, Gemini, or any other supported platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The result? Your AI remembers you, your preferences, your projects, and important context - creating a truly personalized experience that gets better over time.
