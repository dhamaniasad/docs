This page covers common questions about how MemoryPlugin works across various AI tools.

## Introduction

MemoryPlugin adds long-term memory capabilities to your favorite AI tools. At its core, MemoryPlugin solves a fundamental limitation of current AI models: they don't inherently "remember" information between sessions.

## Understanding AI Memory

Modern AI models don't actually have persistent memory. Even during a multi-turn conversation, the AI appears to "remember" previous exchanges only because the entire conversation history is fed back into its context window with each new message. 

<Info>
The context window is essentially the amount of text an AI can process at one time.

## How MemoryPlugin Bridges the Gap

MemoryPlugin works by:

1. **Storing important information** from your conversations
2. **Injecting those memories** back into the AI's context window when needed

Think of it as creating a digital notepad of important information that gets automatically shared with your AI at the start of relevant conversations.

## Two Core Functions

MemoryPlugin performs two key functions:

### 1. Storing Memories

Not everything should be remembered. MemoryPlugin is designed to capture truly relevant information through:

- **User-directed storage**: Explicitly telling the AI what to remember
- **AI-assisted recognition**: The AI identifying potentially important information worth remembering

The storage mechanism varies slightly depending on which integration you're using:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Browser Extension">
    The AI formats important information in a specific way that our extension recognizes and sends to our secure servers
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom GPT">
    Uses function/tool calls to store memories directly through OpenAI's system
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MCP Server">
    Uses tool calls for memory storage through your MCP client
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypingMind Plugin">
    Uses tool calls to store memories through the plugin interface
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Privacy: Only the memory text itself is sent to MemoryPlugin servers, never your full chat history. This applies to all integration methods.
</Note>

### 2. Making Memories Available

When you start a new conversation, MemoryPlugin makes your stored memories available to the AI through one of several methods:

- **Browser Extension**: A button press injects your memories into the chat
- **Custom GPT**: Automatically loads memories through function calls
- **MCP Server**: Loads memories when instructed, either in project instructions or within a chat

In all cases, the system is taking your stored memory text and strategically placing it in the AI's context window, allowing the AI to "remember" important information from past interactions.

## Cross-Platform Power

What makes MemoryPlugin truly powerful is its ability to work across dozens of different AI platforms. Instead of being limited to the memory system of a single AI tool, your memories travel with you across:

- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini
- TypingMind
- LibreChat
- And many others

This creates a seamless memory experience regardless of which AI assistant you're using at any given moment.

## In Summary

MemoryPlugin enhances AI tools by creating a persistent memory layer that works across platforms. By strategically storing relevant information and intelligently injecting it back into conversations when needed, MemoryPlugin makes AI interactions more personalized, efficient, and valuable.
