## Understanding AI Memory

### The Problem: AI Amnesia

Every time you start a new chat with ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI, it has no memory of your previous conversations. You're starting from scratch every single time.

<Warning>
Without MemoryPlugin, you need to re-explain your context, preferences, and important details in every new conversation.
</Warning>

### The Solution: Persistent Memory

MemoryPlugin creates a memory layer that works across all AI platforms. Information you share once is remembered forever (or until you delete it).

## How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Storing Memories">
    **Automatic Memory Creation**
    ```
    You: "I'm working on a React project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS"
    AI: "I'll remember that for future conversations..."
    ```
    
    **Manual Memory Creation**
    ```
    You: "Remember that my dog's name is Max and he's a golden retriever"
    AI: "I've saved that to your memory..."
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using Memories">
    In a new conversation:
    ```
    You: "What kind of dog do I have?"
    AI: "You have a golden retriever named Max."
    ```
    
    The AI automatically retrieves relevant memories based on context.
  </Tab>
