MemoryPlugin can be used across dozens of AI tools through our MCP Server implementation.

<Info>
[Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) is one of the most popular MCP clients since Anthropic created the MCP protocol, but there are 100+ other tools that support MCP.
</Info>

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a new system developed by Anthropic to standardize how AI systems communicate with and use external data sources and tools.

MCP works with two components:

- **MCP Clients**: The applications you use to interact with AI (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- **MCP Servers**: Tools that provide capabilities to those clients (like MemoryPlugin for memory, file access tools, web search, etc.)

<Info>
Think of it like this: The MCP Client is your AI chat app, and MCP Servers are plugins that give your AI new abilities. MemoryPlugin is one such server that adds memory capabilities.
</Info>

## Setup Requirements

<Warning>
MCP setup is currently more technical and requires some developer knowledge. We're working on making this easier.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** - Required to run the MCP server. [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **An MCP Client** - Such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or another supported application
3. **MemoryPlugin Account** - To get your authentication token

### How to Set Up

MCP servers are not "installed" like traditional software. Instead, you configure your MCP client to run the MemoryPlugin server when needed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Auth Token">
    Sign in to the [MemoryPlugin Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard) and copy your authentication token
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your MCP Client">
    Add the MemoryPlugin server configuration to your MCP client's settings file (see example below)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Custom Instructions">
    Tell your AI to use MemoryPlugin for memory operations
  </Step>
</Steps>

For detailed setup instructions specific to your MCP client:
- **Official MCP Documentation**: [modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
- **MemoryPlugin NPM Page**: [@memoryplugin/mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@memoryplugin/mcp-server)

## Configuration Example

Each MCP client has its own configuration format, but they all work similarly. Here's an example for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoryplugin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@memoryplugin/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PLUGIN_TOKEN": "your-auth-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
This configuration tells your MCP client to run `npx @memoryplugin/mcp-server` when needed, which downloads and executes the MemoryPlugin server automatically. No installation required!
</Info>

## Features Available via MCP

When using MemoryPlugin through MCP, you get:

- **Load Memories**: Access your stored memories in any conversation
- **Create Memories**: Save important information for future reference
- **Manage Buckets**: Organize memories into different contexts
- **Search Memories**: Find specific information quickly
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Access the same memories across all your tools

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Node.js not found">
    Make sure Node.js is installed and available in your PATH. Test by running `node --version` in your terminal. You should see a version number like `v20.10.0`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auth token invalid">
    Verify your auth token is correct and copied completely from the dashboard. The token should be a long string of characters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MCP server not connecting">
    1. Check your MCP client's configuration file for typos
    2. Ensure the configuration is in the correct location for your client
    3. Try running `npx @memoryplugin/mcp-server` directly in terminal to test if it works
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memories not loading">
    Make sure you've added custom instructions telling your AI to use MemoryPlugin for memory operations.
