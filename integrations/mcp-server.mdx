# MCP Server

MemoryPlugin can be used across dozens of AI tools (list growing every day) through the use of our MCP Server.

The Desktop app for [Claude](https://claude.ai/download) is one of the most popular MCP clients (as they are the creators of the MCP protocol), but there are many others that support MCP too.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a new system developed by Anthropic to standardize how AI systems communicate with and use external data sources and tools.

<Info>
Think of MCP Clients as the app you're using to chat with your AI, and the MCP servers are the tools that are made available to that app.
</Info>

In this context, MemoryPlugin is available as an MCP Server.

## Installation

<Warning>
MCP is currently not very end-user friendly and is more tailored to developers.
</Warning>

The MemoryPlugin MCP server is based on NodeJS. You will need to ensure you have NodeJS installed to be able to use the MemoryPlugin MCP.

### Prerequisites

1. **NodeJS** - Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **MCP Client** - Such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or another supported client

### Setup Instructions

1. Follow the [MCP quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) to understand how to set up MCP servers

2. Install the MemoryPlugin MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm install @memoryplugin/mcp-server
   ```

3. Get your Auth Token from the [Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard) and set it in the `MEMORY_PLUGIN_TOKEN` environment variable

4. Configure your MCP client to use the MemoryPlugin server

For detailed instructions, visit our [NPM package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@memoryplugin/mcp-server?activeTab=readme).
