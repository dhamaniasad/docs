Custom GPTs are plugins for the ChatGPT app that can be used on mobile, desktop, and web. MemoryPlugin is offered as a Custom GPT that automatically manages your memories.

## MemoryPlugin Custom GPT

MemoryPlugin is available as an official Custom GPT:

## How to Use

When using MemoryPlugin via the Custom GPT, you need to start chats with the Custom GPT for it to automatically add and load memories.

<Warning>
Custom GPTs only support GPT-4o and GPT-5 Auto models. If you want to use other ChatGPT models like GPT-5 Pro, GPT-4.1, or legacy models, or other AI platforms like Claude or Gemini, the [browser extension](/integrations/browser-extension) is a better choice.
</Warning>

### Starting a New Chat

1. Navigate to the MemoryPlugin Custom GPT
2. Start a new conversation - memories will load automatically
3. The GPT will fetch your existing memories at the beginning of each chat
4. You can ask it to load memories from a specific bucket if needed

### Using in Existing Chats

On web and desktop, you can invoke the Custom GPT into an existing chat with certain models:

1. Type `@` in the chat input
2. Type "MemoryPlugin" to find and select it
3. Once selected, all messages will be processed by the Custom GPT's model (GPT-4o or GPT-5 Auto) instead of your chosen model
4. You can ask it to load memories or add new memories while active

## Features

### Automatic Memory Loading

The Custom GPT is instructed to automatically load memories at the start of new chats, providing immediate context about you and your previous conversations.

### Memory Management

- **Add memories**: Ask the GPT to remember specific information
- **Load from buckets**: Request memories from specific buckets

### Cross-Platform Sync

Memories created through the Custom GPT are synchronized with all other MemoryPlugin integrations, so they're available in the browser extension, MCP server, and other integrations.

## Limitations

<Warning>
Keep these limitations in mind when using the Custom GPT:
</Warning>

- Only works with GPT-4o model
- Cannot switch to other models while the Custom GPT is active
- Requires starting new chats with the Custom GPT for automatic memory loading
- When invoked with `@` in existing chats, all subsequent messages use GPT-4o

## Use Cases

The Custom GPT integration is ideal for:

- **Mobile users** who want memory functionality on their phones
- **Quick memory access** without needing to install extensions
- **GPT-4o workflows** where the model restriction isn't an issue
- **Automatic memory management** with minimal setup required
