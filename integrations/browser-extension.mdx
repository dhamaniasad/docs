## How to Use the Browser Extension

Once you install the browser extension, when you open supported AI tool websites, you will see a round MemoryPlugin button at the bottom right of the page. If you click on this button, you will be able to see all your memories and switch between active buckets.

### Button Variations

Depending on the platform you are using, you will see:

1. **Quick Inject Button**: A larger button with "Quick Inject" text on top
2. **Small MemoryPlugin Button**: A smaller button near the chat input box

Both buttons perform the same function - activating MemoryPlugin for your current chat.

## Injecting Memories

<Warning>
The browser extension does not automatically inject memories into your chats. You need to press the MemoryPlugin button to activate MemoryPlugin for a given chat.
</Warning>

When you press the MemoryPlugin button, two things are added to the chat:

1. **Your memories** from the chosen bucket in the MemoryPlugin window
2. **Instructions for the AI** on how and when to add new memories

Without this activation step, MemoryPlugin is not active for the chat and your AI will not be able to read existing memories or create new ones.

When you press the MemoryPlugin button, you will see text added to the chat input field that:

1. Instructs the AI about what MemoryPlugin is and how to use it
2. Contains current memories from your chosen bucket  
3. Instructs the AI on what to add to memory, and how

## Adding New Memories

When you activate MemoryPlugin for a chat, the AI is instructed how to add new memories using a specific format:

```
to=memoryplugin&&memory=[memory text here]
```

The AI will trigger a new memory addition in one of two cases:

- **Automatic**: It thinks something is worth remembering long term
- **Manual**: You explicitly ask it to remember something

### Visual Feedback

When a new memory is added, you will see the round MemoryPlugin button briefly show a checkmark (âœ“) to indicate it has detected and successfully added the new memory.
