## How to Use the Browser Extension

Once you install the browser extension, when you open supported AI tool websites, you will see a round MemoryPlugin button at the bottom right of the page. If you click on this button, you will be able to see all your memories and switch between active buckets.

### Extension Interface

The MemoryPlugin panel provides:

- **Memory List**: View all memories in your selected bucket
- **Bucket Selector**: Switch between different memory buckets (contexts)
- **Memory Count**: See how many memories are in each bucket
- **Smart Mode Toggle**: Enable Smart Mode when available (gradual rollout)

### Button Variations

Depending on the platform you are using, you will see:

1. **Quick Inject Button**: A larger button with "Quick Inject" text on top
2. **Small MemoryPlugin Button**: A smaller button near the chat input box

![Quick Inject button near the chat input](/images/browser-extension/quick-inject-button.png)

Both buttons perform the same function - activating MemoryPlugin for your current chat.

### Memory Buckets

Organize your memories into different contexts using buckets:

- **Personal**: Personal information and preferences
- **Work**: Professional context and work-related information
- **Projects**: Specific project details and requirements
- **Custom Buckets**: Create your own categories as needed

<Tip>
Switch between buckets using the dropdown in the MemoryPlugin panel before injecting memories to use the appropriate context for your conversation.
</Tip>

## Injecting Memories

<Warning>
The browser extension does not automatically inject memories into your chats. You need to press the MemoryPlugin button to activate MemoryPlugin for a given chat.
</Warning>

When you press the MemoryPlugin button, two things are added to the chat:

1. **Your memories** from the chosen bucket in the MemoryPlugin window
2. **Instructions for the AI** on how and when to add new memories

Without this activation step, MemoryPlugin is not active for the chat and your AI will not be able to read existing memories or create new ones.

When you press the MemoryPlugin button, you will see text added to the chat input field that:

1. Instructs the AI about what MemoryPlugin is and how to use it
2. Contains current memories from your chosen bucket  
3. Instructs the AI on what to add to memory, and how

## Adding New Memories

When you activate MemoryPlugin for a chat, the AI is instructed how to add new memories using a specific format:

```
to=memoryplugin&&memory=[memory text here]
```

The AI will trigger a new memory addition in one of two cases:

- **Automatic**: It thinks something is worth remembering long term
- **Manual**: You explicitly ask it to remember something

### Visual Feedback

When a new memory is added, you will see the round MemoryPlugin button briefly show a checkmark (âœ“) to indicate it has detected and successfully added the new memory.

## Smart Mode

<Info>
Smart Mode is currently undergoing a gradual rollout. If you'd like faster access, please contact support.
</Info>

Smart Mode optimizes token consumption and keeps the AI focused by intelligently organizing and presenting your memories.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Categorization**: Analyzes all memories in a bucket and identifies 4-7 main categories
2. **Category Summaries**: Creates concise summaries for each category
3. **Smart Loading**: Only loads full category details when relevant to the conversation
4. **Token Efficiency**: Reduces token usage by not overwhelming the AI with irrelevant memories

### Setup

To enable Smart Mode:
1. Select a specific bucket (Smart Mode doesn't work with "All memories")
2. Activate Smart Mode for that bucket in the web app (one-time setup)
3. New memories will automatically be assigned to appropriate categories

### Benefits
- **Reduced Token Usage**: Only relevant memories are loaded
- **Better Focus**: AI isn't distracted by unrelated information
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI knows high-level information about all categories
- **Automatic Management**: New memories are categorized automatically

## Supported Platforms

The browser extension works with all major AI platforms:
