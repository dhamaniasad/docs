## Features

When integrated with TypingMind, MemoryPlugin provides:

- **Automatic Memory Storage**: AI proactively stores important information
- **Cross-Model Memory**: Share memories between different AI models in TypingMind
- **Memory Buckets**: Organize memories for different projects or contexts  
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific memories using natural language queries
- **Date Stamping**: Automatically adds dates to stored memories

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Start a conversation** in TypingMind with MemoryPlugin enabled
2. **The AI will automatically store** important information as you chat
3. **Use `\m` at the end** of a message to explicitly request memory storage
4. **Specify buckets** when you want to organize memories by context

### Working with Buckets

```text
"Load my work bucket" - AI uses load_bucket mode
"Remember this in my personal bucket: I prefer morning meetings" - AI stores in specific bucket
"Search my project memories for deadlines" - AI searches within context
```

### Memory Shortcuts

- **`\m`**: Add the preceding information to memory
- **Automatic Storage**: AI detects and stores important information
- **Smart Loading**: AI loads relevant memories based on conversation context

## Plugin Behavior

### Automatic Features

- **Proactive Storage**: The AI automatically detects and stores important information
- **Context Awareness**: Uses conversation context to determine what's worth remembering
- **Date Stamping**: All memories include timestamps for better organization
- **Error Handling**: Shows helpful messages if authentication fails

### User Controls

- **Explicit Memory**: Use `\m` to force storage of specific information
- **Bucket Selection**: Direct the AI to use specific memory buckets
- **Search Queries**: Find specific information from your memory collection
