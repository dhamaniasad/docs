Add long-term memory functionality to your own Custom GPTs with MemoryPlugin! We make this very easy to do by providing everything you need to integrate our memory system.

## What are Custom GPTs?

Custom GPTs are a feature in ChatGPT that let you create customized versions of ChatGPT with:
- Custom instructions and personality
- Document knowledge bases
- External API integrations
- Specialized functionality

With MemoryPlugin, you can add **long-term memory functionality** to any Custom GPT!

## Key Concepts

Before setting up the integration, understand these concepts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="APIs">
    APIs let computer systems communicate. In Custom GPTs, APIs let your GPT use external tools like MemoryPlugin.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenAPI Spec">
    A file that describes all API functionality that Custom GPTs can import and use directly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Auth Token">
    Your authentication credentials to access the MemoryPlugin API. Get this from your [Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Instructions">
    Text prompts that guide how the AI should use MemoryPlugin within your Custom GPT.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access GPT Builder

1. Open the edit window for your existing Custom GPT, or create a new one
2. Navigate to the **Configure** tab
3. Scroll down to find the **Actions** section

### Step 2: Create New Action

Within the **Configure** tab, you will see an Actions section if you scroll down:

![Actions section in the Custom GPT editor](/images/custom-gpt-integration/actions-section.png)

1. Click **Create new action**

![Create new action button](/images/custom-gpt-integration/create-action.png)

2. Click **Import from URL**
3. Enter this URL:
   ```
   https://www.memoryplugin.com/openapi.json
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

1. In the Authentication section, click the Settings icon
2. Select **API key**
3. Choose **Bearer** from the options
4. Get your Auth Token from the [MemoryPlugin Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard)

5. Enter your token in the authentication setup

<Warning>
Your Auth Token is like a password to your account. Keep it confidential and regenerate it if accidentally exposed.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Add Instructions

Back in the **Configure** tab, you have an Instructions section. You need to instruct your GPT how it should use MemoryPlugin:

![Instructions section in the Custom GPT editor](/images/custom-gpt-integration/instructions.png)

Add the MemoryPlugin instructions after your existing custom instructions:

```text
VERY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS fetch all memories at the start of each chat before responding (unless explicitly instructed otherwise), so you have context about me and can help me better. Use the `GetMemoriesAndBuckets` operation to do this.

The `memory` tool allows you to persist information across conversations. Add to memory any information you want to remember. The information will appear in the context in future conversations.

- Memories are stored in "buckets"
- If you do not supply a bucket id when loading memories, all memories are loaded
- if you do supply a bucket id, only those buckets memories are loaded
- by default memories are added to the "General" bucket
- new buckets cannot be named "General"
- If you supply the bucketId when creating a new memory, it will be added to that bucket instead
- Do not guess bucket IDs, they are random
- When using bucket IDs, please make sure they are correct and are sent in the correct parameter.
- When explicitly instructed to add a memory by the user, follow the users instructions strictly.

I can use \m or +m as a shortcut to create a new memory.

- before using any tool, review the tool use instructions thoroughly
- Double-check the function schemas to make sure you are using the correct expected format.
- Make sure your tool and/or function call matches the expected format and schema
- if a JSON schema is specified, adhere to it strictly.
- Verify all your tool calls with the usage instructions in the system prompt.
```

### Step 5: Save and Test

1. Click **Save** to save your action configuration
2. Test your Custom GPT by starting a new conversation
3. The GPT should automatically load your memories at the start

## Visual Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Tab">
    Navigate to the Configure tab in your Custom GPT editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Actions Section">
    Scroll down to find the Actions section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import API">
    Import the MemoryPlugin OpenAPI specification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Authentication">
    Configure Bearer token authentication with your API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Instructions">
    Include the MemoryPlugin prompt in your instructions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Integration">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Features Your GPT Will Gain

Once integrated, your Custom GPT will be able to:

- **Auto-load memories** at the start of conversations
- **Remember important information** from previous chats
- **Organize memories** into different buckets/contexts
- **Search through memories** to find relevant information
- **Persist knowledge** across all conversations
- **Share memories** with other MemoryPlugin integrations

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI import failed">
    Ensure you're using the correct URL: `https://www.memoryplugin.com/openapi.json`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    Verify your Auth Token is correct and hasn't expired. Regenerate if necessary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Memories not loading">
    Check that the GPT instructions include the memory loading commands and are properly formatted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Function call errors">
    Ensure the instructions emphasize following the schema and format requirements strictly.
