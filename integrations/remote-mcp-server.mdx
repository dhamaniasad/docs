Use MemoryPlugin without installing a local server. Our hosted Remote MCP server lets any compatible MCP client connect over HTTPS with built‑in OAuth 2.0 (PKCE) and Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

<EmailIndependence />

## Endpoints

Use one of the following URLs depending on your client's requirements:

**Base URL (with auto-discovery)**
```
https://www.memoryplugin.com
```

**HTTP (streamable)**
```
https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/mcp
```

**SSE (Server-Sent Events)**
```
https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/sse
```

<Info>
Most clients work with the full endpoint paths, but some may only need the base URL and will auto-discover the MCP endpoints.
</Info>

## When to use Remote MCP

- Zero‑install: no Node.js or local process to manage
- Auto‑updates: get the latest MemoryPlugin MCP features instantly
- Firewall‑friendly: outbound HTTPS only
- Works across devices with the same MemoryPlugin account

If you prefer a local process (e.g., for fully offline), see the [MCP Server (local)](/integrations/mcp-server) page.

## Authentication

The Remote MCP server uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and supports Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). In practice this means:

- Clients that support DCR can register themselves automatically during the first connect flow
- No long‑lived secrets are required from you; the client obtains tokens after authorization
- Tokens are stored by your client according to its security model (e.g., OS keychain)

<Warning>
Do not paste raw API keys into third‑party clients unless their docs explicitly request it. Use the built‑in OAuth flow whenever available.
</Warning>

### High‑level flow

1. Configure your MCP client with the Remote MCP endpoint(s) below
2. Start or refresh the client; it opens the MemoryPlugin OAuth screen
3. Approve access; the client exchanges the code for tokens
4. The client connects to the Remote MCP server and lists available tools

## Client configuration examples

Each MCP client has its own config schema for Remote MCP. Use these templates as a guide and consult your client's documentation for exact keys and capabilities.

### Claude Desktop

Config file location:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoryplugin-remote": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
Claude Desktop will automatically handle OAuth with Dynamic Client Registration during the first connection. No API keys or tokens needed in the config.
</Info>

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot Chat

Project file: `.vscode/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "memoryplugin-remote": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
VS Code supports both HTTP and SSE transports. It will automatically try HTTP first and fall back to SSE if needed. OAuth with DCR is handled automatically.
</Info>

### Cursor, Windsurf, and other clients

- Look for "Remote MCP", "HTTP transport", or "Add server" in your client settings
- Try these URLs in order of preference:
  1. `https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/mcp` (full HTTP endpoint)
  2. `https://www.memoryplugin.com` (base URL with auto-discovery)
- Set type to `"http"` if your client requires it
- Enable OAuth/DCR if available; most modern clients handle this automatically
- If your client asks for static credentials, use the local server instead

### Clients without native remote support

If your client doesn't support remote MCP servers yet, you can use a local proxy like `mcp-remote`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoryplugin-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://www.memoryplugin.com/api/mcp/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This runs a local proxy that connects to the remote server, making it appear as a local MCP server to your client.

## Capabilities

Once connected, MemoryPlugin exposes the same capabilities as the local server:

- Load memories into context
- Create and update memories
- Search memories by natural language
- Work with memory buckets (create, list, target by bucket)

Refer to the in‑client tool list to see the exact set of MCP tools and prompts.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unauthorized (401) or repeated sign‑in prompts">
    Complete the OAuth flow in your default browser. If the issue persists, sign out in your client and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client does not support Remote MCP">
    Use the [local MCP server](/integrations/mcp-server) or check for a newer client version that adds HTTP/SSE transport.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claude Desktop doesn’t pick up config changes">
    Close the app completely, then reopen. On macOS, verify edits in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Network or proxy issues">
    Allow outbound HTTPS to `www.memoryplugin.com`. Some corporate proxies block SSE; prefer the HTTP streamable endpoint if your client supports it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I need static client credentials">
    Some clients require pre‑registered OAuth clients instead of DCR. Check your client docs; if unsupported, use the local server as a fallback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My client doesn't support remote MCP at all">
    Use the `mcp-remote` proxy approach shown above. This creates a local stdio server that forwards requests to the remote endpoint, making it compatible with any MCP client.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
