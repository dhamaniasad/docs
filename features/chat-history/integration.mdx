Once you've uploaded chat history, it automatically becomes available in your new conversations through the Browser Extension or MCP Server.

## Browser Extension

The Browser Extension automatically injects relevant chat history context into your AI conversations.

### How Auto-Injection Works

When you start a new conversation with an AI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You activate MemoryPlugin">
    Click the **Quick Inject button** or **MemoryPlugin button** to enable memory for the conversation
  </Step>

  <Step title="You type your question">
    Enter your prompt as you normally would
  </Step>

  <Step title="MemoryPlugin finds relevant context">
    Your question is analyzed to find relevant past conversations automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context is injected">
    Relevant chat history is intelligently inserted before your prompt
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI responds with context">
    The AI sees your question plus relevant past conversations, giving you more personalized and contextual answers
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This all happens automatically‚Äîyou don't need to do anything special. Just activate MemoryPlugin once per chat and type your questions normally.
</Info>

### Supported Platforms

Chat History Memory auto-injection currently works with:

- ‚úÖ **ChatGPT** (web and desktop)
- ‚úÖ **Claude** (web)
- ‚úÖ **Gemini**
- üîÑ More platforms coming soon

<Note>
For Claude Desktop app, use the [MCP Server integration](#mcp-server) instead.
</Note>

### When Context Is Injected

Context from your chat history is automatically injected when:

- ‚úÖ You've activated MemoryPlugin for the conversation
- ‚úÖ Your prompt is relevant to past discussions
- ‚úÖ Chat history injection is enabled in your settings
- ‚ùå You explicitly disable it for a specific conversation

### Configuring Token Limits

You can control how much chat history context is injected:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are tokens?" icon="coins">
    Tokens are units that AI models use to measure text length. Roughly speaking:
    - 1 token ‚âà 4 characters
    - 100 tokens ‚âà 75 words
    - 600 tokens ‚âà 450 words

    More tokens = more chat history context, but also uses more of your AI's context window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Default setting: 600 tokens" icon="gauge">
    By default, MemoryPlugin injects up to **600 tokens** of chat history context.

    This is approximately 450 words‚Äîenough for meaningful context without overwhelming the AI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum allowed: 2,000 tokens" icon="gauge-high">
    You can increase the limit up to **2,000 tokens** in extension settings for more comprehensive context.

    This is approximately 1,500 words‚Äîuseful for complex topics that need extensive background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why limit tokens?" icon="question">
    **Reason 1**: AI models have limited context windows. Injecting too much chat history leaves less room for your actual conversation.

    **Reason 2**: More tokens can slow down AI responses and increase costs (on API-based tools).

    **Reason 3**: Too much context can sometimes confuse the AI with irrelevant information.

    Start with the default 600 tokens and increase only if you need more context.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Finding the Injection Settings

To adjust token limits:

1. Click the **MemoryPlugin extension icon** in your browser
2. Go to **Settings** or **Options**
3. Look for **Chat History** settings
4. Adjust the **Max Tokens** slider or input
5. Save your changes

<Info>
Changes take effect immediately for new conversations. Existing conversations use the token limit that was active when they started.
</Info>

### What Gets Injected

When relevant chat history is found:

- **Most relevant messages** are selected from past conversations
- **Messages are ranked** by relevance to your current question
- **Context stays within** your configured token limit
- **Long messages may be truncated** with a "[message truncated]" note to fit the budget

You'll see the injected context appear before your prompt in the AI conversation (depending on the platform's UI).

### Enabling and Disabling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Per-Conversation Control" icon="toggle-on">
    You can enable or disable MemoryPlugin (including chat history) for individual conversations:

    - **Enable**: Click the Quick Inject or MemoryPlugin button once per chat
    - **Disable**: Don't click the button, or toggle it off in the extension popup

    Chat history only injects in conversations where MemoryPlugin is active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Global Settings" icon="gear">
    You can also disable chat history injection entirely in extension settings while keeping Regular Memory active.

    This is useful if you want to use MemoryPlugin but not chat history for a while.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## MCP Server

The MemoryPlugin MCP Server also supports Chat History Memory for MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

### How It Works

The MCP Server works similarly to the Browser Extension:

- Chat history is automatically available to MCP tools
- Relevant context is retrieved when needed
- Works with all MCP-compatible clients
- Same token limits apply (configurable in MCP settings)

### Supported Clients

- **Claude Desktop** (official Anthropic app)
- **Cursor** (code editor)
- **Continue** (VS Code extension)
- **Other MCP-compatible clients**

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MCP Server">
    Follow the [MCP Server installation guide](/integrations/mcp-server) to set up MemoryPlugin for your MCP client.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Chat History">
    Upload your chat history via the [Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history) as described in the [Overview](/features/chat-history/overview).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Normally">
    Chat history becomes automatically available through the MCP server. No additional configuration needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
MCP Server configuration is done in your client's config file (e.g., Claude Desktop config). See the [MCP Server docs](/integrations/mcp-server) for details.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with default token limits" icon="play">
    The default 600 tokens works well for most use cases. Only increase if you consistently need more context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor performance" icon="gauge">
    If AI responses become slow or less relevant, try reducing the token limit. More context isn't always better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use exclusions for privacy" icon="eye-slash">
    If you have sensitive chats you don't want injected, [exclude them](/features/chat-history/dashboard#excluding-chats) from the Chats tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disable for creative tasks" icon="lightbulb">
    For creative writing or brainstorming where you don't want past context influencing the AI, disable MemoryPlugin for that conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable for ongoing projects" icon="folder">
    For work projects with extensive history, chat history injection helps maintain continuity across conversations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Not Appearing" icon="message-slash">
    **Symptoms**: Chat history context isn't being injected into conversations

    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure Browser Extension or MCP Server is installed and signed in
    - Click the MemoryPlugin/Quick Inject button to activate for the conversation
    - Check that chat history feature is enabled in settings
    - Verify you have uploaded and processed chat history
    - Check if your current platform is supported
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Much / Too Little Context" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Symptoms**: Context injection is too verbose or too minimal

    **Solutions**:
    - Adjust max tokens in extension settings
    - Try increasing from 600 to 1,000-1,500 for more context
    - Try decreasing to 300-400 for less context
    - Remember: changes apply to new conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Irrelevant Context Appearing" icon="filter">
    **Symptoms**: Injected chat history isn't relevant to your question

    **Solutions**:
    - Exclude irrelevant chats from the Chats tab
    - Be more specific in your prompts
    - Reduce token limit to focus on most relevant matches
    - Delete old imports you no longer need
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Seems Confused" icon="circle-question">
    **Symptoms**: AI responses are less helpful after enabling chat history

    **Solutions**:
    - Try reducing the token limit‚Äîtoo much context can confuse
    - Exclude older or off-topic chats
    - Disable chat history for that specific conversation and try again
    - Clear your Regular Memory if there are conflicts
  </Accordion>
