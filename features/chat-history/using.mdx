Once you've imported your chat history, you can use it in three powerful ways: auto-injection into new conversations, searching across all your history, and asking questions with AI-powered analysis.

## Auto-Injection via Browser Extension & MCP

Chat history automatically injects relevant context into your new AI conversations.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You start a conversation">
    Activate MemoryPlugin by clicking the Quick Inject or MemoryPlugin button
  </Step>

  <Step title="You type your question">
    Enter your prompt as you normally would
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relevant context is found">
    Your question is analyzed to find relevant past conversations automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context is injected">
    Relevant chat history is intelligently inserted before your prompt
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI responds with context">
    The AI sees your question plus relevant past conversations for more personalized answers
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This happens automatically—just activate MemoryPlugin once per chat and type your questions normally.
</Info>

### Platform Support

Auto-injection works on **all platforms** supported by our integrations:

**Via Browser Extension:**
- ChatGPT • Claude • Gemini • Google AI Studio • Grok • Poe • DeepSeek • Qwen • And more...

**Via MCP Server:**
- Claude Desktop • Cursor • Continue • Other MCP-compatible clients

<Note>
Need to install? See [Browser Extension Setup](/integrations/browser-extension) or [MCP Server Setup](/integrations/mcp-server)
</Note>

### Token Limits

Control how much chat history context gets injected:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default: 600 tokens" icon="gauge">
    By default, MemoryPlugin injects up to **600 tokens** (≈450 words) of chat history context.

    This is enough for meaningful context without overwhelming the AI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum: 2,000 tokens" icon="gauge-high">
    You can increase the limit up to **2,000 tokens** (≈1,500 words) in extension settings for more comprehensive context.

    Useful for complex topics that need extensive background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why limit tokens?" icon="question">
    **AI context windows are limited** - Injecting too much chat history leaves less room for your actual conversation.

    **More tokens = slower responses** - Can increase API costs and response time.

    **Too much context can confuse** - Irrelevant information may reduce response quality.

    **Start with default 600 tokens** and increase only if you need more context.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Gets Injected

When relevant chat history is found:
- Most relevant messages are selected from past conversations
- Messages are ranked by relevance to your current question
- Context stays within your configured token limit
- Long messages may be truncated with "[message truncated]" to fit the budget

### Adjusting Settings

**Browser Extension:**
1. Click the MemoryPlugin extension icon
2. Go to Settings
3. Look for Chat History settings
4. Adjust Max Tokens slider
5. Save changes

**MCP Server:**
Configure token limits in your MCP client's config file. See [MCP Server docs](/integrations/mcp-server) for details.

### Controlling What Gets Injected

Use [exclusions](/features/chat-history/importing#excluding-chats) to prevent specific chats from being injected:
- Sensitive conversations you want to keep private
- Off-topic chats that aren't useful for context
- Outdated discussions no longer relevant

Excluded chats remain stored but won't appear in search or auto-injection.

## Search Your History

Perform powerful semantic searches across your entire chat history.

### How to Search

1. Go to the **Search tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Enter your query in natural language (e.g., "discussions about authentication")
3. Apply optional filters (platform, date range)
4. Adjust settings (context window size, reranking)
5. View results with matched content and surrounding context

### Search Features

- **Natural language** - No boolean operators needed, just ask naturally
- **Semantic understanding** - Finds conceptually related content, not just keywords
- **Context windows** - See messages before and after matched content
- **Relevance ranking** - Best matches appear first
- **Platform filtering** - Search across all or filter by ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind
- **View full conversation** - Click any result to open the complete chat

### Search Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific but natural" icon="message-question">
    ✅ Good: "discussions about implementing JWT authentication"

    ❌ Avoid: "auth AND jwt OR security"

    Use natural language—the system understands context better than boolean operators.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use date filters for recent topics" icon="calendar">
    If you remember roughly when a conversation happened, narrow down results with the date range filter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust context window" icon="window">
    - **Small (1-5 chunks)**: Precise matches only
    - **Medium (6-15 chunks)**: Balanced context
    - **Large (16-30 chunks)**: Maximum surrounding conversation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Try rephrasing if needed" icon="rotate">
    If you don't find what you're looking for, try asking the same thing in different words.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by platform" icon="filter">
    If you remember which AI you were chatting with, filter to just that platform for faster results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding Results

Each search result shows:
- Matched content highlighted in context
- Conversation title and date
- Platform it came from
- Message count in that conversation
- Relevance score (higher = better match)

Click any result to view the full conversation with all messages.

<Note>
Search has a 30-second timeout. If your query times out, try being more specific or using date filters to narrow the scope.
</Note>

## Ask Questions (AI-Powered Analysis)

Ask natural language questions and get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history.

### How to Use

1. Go to the **Ask tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Ask a question in natural language about your chat history
3. The AI searches for relevant conversations automatically
4. Get a comprehensive answer with citations to source conversations
5. Follow up with related questions

### Example Questions

- "What have I discussed about authentication strategies?"
- "Show me all conversations about the UserProfile component"
- "What decisions did I make about database architecture?"
- "Summarize my discussions about API design patterns"
- "What feedback did I receive on my pricing page redesign?"

### How It Works

- **Multi-step reasoning** - The AI searches multiple times to find complete answers
- **Automatic tool use** - Searches by keywords, topics, and timeframes as needed
- **Context-aware** - Understands your question and retrieves the most relevant information
- **Comprehensive synthesis** - Combines information from multiple sources into one answer (typically 500+ words)

### Understanding Answers

Each answer includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synthesized Response" icon="message">
    Comprehensive answer drawing from multiple conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Source Citations" icon="quote-left">
    References to specific conversations where information was found
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Snippets" icon="align-left">
    Relevant excerpts from the cited conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confidence Indicators" icon="gauge">
    How certain the AI is about the answer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
The Ask feature can take 30-120 seconds for complex queries as it searches and analyzes your history. Be patient while it works.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with default token limits" icon="play">
    The default 600 tokens works well for most use cases. Only increase if you consistently need more context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor performance" icon="gauge">
    If AI responses become slow or less relevant, try reducing the token limit. More context isn't always better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use exclusions for privacy" icon="eye-slash">
    If you have sensitive chats you don't want injected, [exclude them](/features/chat-history/importing#excluding-chats) from the Chats tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disable for creative tasks" icon="lightbulb">
    For creative writing or brainstorming where you don't want past context influencing the AI, disable MemoryPlugin for that conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable for ongoing projects" icon="folder">
    For work projects with extensive history, chat history injection helps maintain continuity across conversations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Not Appearing" icon="message-slash">
    **Symptoms**: Chat history context isn't being injected into conversations

    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure Browser Extension or MCP Server is installed and signed in
    - Click the MemoryPlugin/Quick Inject button to activate for the conversation
    - Check that chat history feature is enabled in settings
    - Verify you have uploaded and processed chat history
    - Check if your current platform is supported
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Much / Too Little Context" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Symptoms**: Context injection is too verbose or too minimal

    **Solutions**:
    - Adjust max tokens in extension settings
    - Try increasing from 600 to 1,000-1,500 for more context
    - Try decreasing to 300-400 for less context
    - Remember: changes apply to new conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Irrelevant Context Appearing" icon="filter">
    **Symptoms**: Injected chat history isn't relevant to your question

    **Solutions**:
    - Exclude irrelevant chats from the Chats tab
    - Be more specific in your prompts
    - Reduce token limit to focus on most relevant matches
    - Delete old imports you no longer need
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search Returns No Results" icon="magnifying-glass-minus">
    **Symptoms**: Search doesn't find expected conversations

    **Solutions**:
    - Try different phrasings of your query
    - Remove date filters and search again
    - Check if the chat was excluded from indexing
    - Verify the conversation was successfully processed
    - Try broader search terms
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Seems Confused" icon="circle-question">
    **Symptoms**: AI responses are less helpful after enabling chat history

    **Solutions**:
    - Try reducing the token limit—too much context can confuse
    - Exclude older or off-topic chats
    - Disable chat history for that specific conversation and try again
    - Clear your Regular Memory if there are conflicts
