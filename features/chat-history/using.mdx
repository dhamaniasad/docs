Once you've imported your chat history, you can use it to add relevant context to your new AI conversations.

## See It In Action

Here's what Chat History Memory does for your conversations:

**Without MemoryPlugin:**

![Without MemoryPlugin](/images/chat-history/mcp-without-memoryplugin.png)

The AI has no context about your past conversations and gives generic responses.

**With MemoryPlugin:**

![With MemoryPlugin](/images/chat-history/mcp-with-memoryplugin.png)

The AI sees relevant context from your chat history and provides personalized, informed responses based on your previous discussions.

## Auto-Injection via Browser Extension & MCP

Chat history can automatically surface relevant context from past conversations in your new chats.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You start a conversation">
    Activate MemoryPlugin by clicking the Quick Inject or MemoryPlugin button
  </Step>

  <Step title="You type your question">
    Enter your prompt as you normally would
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relevant context is found">
    Your question is analyzed to find relevant past conversations automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context is added">
    Relevant chat history is intelligently inserted before your prompt
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI responds with context">
    The AI sees your question plus relevant past conversations for more personalized answers
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This happens automatically—just activate MemoryPlugin once per chat and type your questions normally.
</Info>

### Platform Support

Auto-injection works on **all platforms** supported by our integrations:

**Via Browser Extension:**
- ChatGPT • Claude • Gemini • Google AI Studio • Grok • Poe • DeepSeek • Qwen • And more...

**Via MCP Server:**
- Claude Desktop • Cursor • Continue • Other MCP-compatible clients

<Note>
Need to install? See [Browser Extension Setup](/integrations/browser-extension) or [MCP Server Setup](/integrations/mcp-server)
</Note>

### Token Limits

Control how much chat history context gets added to your conversations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default: 600 tokens" icon="gauge">
    By default, MemoryPlugin adds up to **600 tokens** (≈450 words) of chat history context.

    This is enough for meaningful context without overwhelming the AI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum: 2,000 tokens" icon="gauge-high">
    You can increase the limit up to **2,000 tokens** (≈1,500 words) in extension settings for more comprehensive context.

    Useful for complex topics that need extensive background.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why limit tokens?" icon="question">
    **AI context windows are limited** - Adding too much chat history leaves less room for your actual conversation.

    **More tokens = slower responses** - Can increase API costs and response time.

    **Too much context can confuse** - Irrelevant information may reduce response quality.

    **Start with default 600 tokens** and increase only if you need more context.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Gets Added

When relevant chat history is found:
- Most relevant messages are selected from past conversations
- Messages are ranked by relevance to your current question
- Context stays within your configured token limit
- Long messages may be truncated with "[message truncated]" to fit the budget

### Adjusting Settings

**Browser Extension:**
1. Click the MemoryPlugin extension icon
2. Go to Settings
3. Look for Chat History settings
4. Adjust Max Tokens slider
5. Save changes

**MCP Server:**
Configure token limits in your MCP client's config file. See [MCP Server docs](/integrations/mcp-server) for details.

### Controlling What Gets Added

Use [exclusions](/features/chat-history/dashboard#excluding-chats) to remove specific chats from being used as context:
- Sensitive conversations you want to keep private
- Off-topic chats that aren't useful for context
- Outdated discussions no longer relevant

When you exclude a chat, its data is deleted and it won't be re-imported in future uploads. A placeholder remains to prevent automatic re-processing.

## Searching and Analyzing Your History

Beyond auto-injection, you can actively search and analyze your chat history:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Search Your History" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Perform powerful semantic searches across all your conversations. Find specific discussions by topic, keyword, or timeframe.

    [Go to Dashboard → Search](/features/chat-history/dashboard#search-tab)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask Questions" icon="message-question">
    Get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history. Ask natural language questions and receive comprehensive responses with citations.

    [Go to Dashboard → Ask](/features/chat-history/dashboard#ask-tab)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with default token limits" icon="play">
    The default 600 tokens works well for most use cases. Only increase if you consistently need more context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor performance" icon="gauge">
    If AI responses become slow or less relevant, try reducing the token limit. More context isn't always better.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use exclusions for privacy" icon="eye-slash">
    If you have sensitive chats you don't want injected, [exclude them](/features/chat-history/dashboard#excluding-chats) from the Chats tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Disable for creative tasks" icon="lightbulb">
    For creative writing or brainstorming where you don't want past context influencing the AI, disable MemoryPlugin for that conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable for ongoing projects" icon="folder">
    For work projects with extensive history, chat history injection helps maintain continuity across conversations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Not Appearing" icon="message-slash">
    **Symptoms**: Chat history context isn't being added to conversations

    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure Browser Extension or MCP Server is installed and signed in
    - Click the MemoryPlugin/Quick Inject button to activate for the conversation
    - Check that chat history feature is enabled in settings
    - Verify you have uploaded and processed chat history
    - Check if your current platform is supported
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Much / Too Little Context" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Symptoms**: Context is too verbose or too minimal

    **Solutions**:
    - Adjust max tokens in extension settings
    - Try increasing from 600 to 1,000-1,500 for more context
    - Try decreasing to 300-400 for less context
    - Remember: changes apply to new conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Irrelevant Context Appearing" icon="filter">
    **Symptoms**: Added chat history isn't relevant to your question

    **Solutions**:
    - Exclude irrelevant chats from the Chats tab
    - Be more specific in your prompts
    - Reduce token limit to focus on most relevant matches
    - Delete old imports you no longer need
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI Seems Confused" icon="circle-question">
    **Symptoms**: AI responses are less helpful after enabling chat history

    **Solutions**:
    - Try reducing the token limit—too much context can confuse
    - Exclude older or off-topic chats
    - Disable chat history for that specific conversation and try again
    - Clear your Regular Memory if there are conflicts
  </Accordion>
