## What is Chat History Memory?

Chat History Memory gives MemoryPlugin the ability to remember **every conversation** you've ever had with your AI tools—not just snippets, but complete discussions spanning months or years.

### How It's Different from Regular Memory

**Regular Memory** stores condensed facts:

```
- Sarah is a software engineer with 5 years experience
- Prefers React over Vue
- Working on an e-commerce side project
- Learns best through examples
```

**Chat History Memory** stores the actual conversations where those facts came from:

```
"I've been trying to learn React hooks for my e-commerce project.
I watched some tutorials but I'm still confused about useEffect..."

"That example really helped! I learn much better when I can see
the code in context rather than just reading documentation..."

"I tried Vue last year but the reactivity model didn't click for me.
React's component lifecycle makes more sense to my brain..."
```

**The key difference:** Regular Memory knows _what_ - Chat History Memory knows _how_ and _why_. It understands your thought process, learning style, past struggles, and the context behind each fact.

With Chat History, the AI sees that you struggled with useEffect but understood it through examples. It knows you prefer React because Vue's reactivity didn't click. It can reference your actual e-commerce project challenges, not just that you're "working on a project."

## Why It Matters

If you use AI tools regularly, you've likely had **hundreds or thousands** of conversations covering:

- **Learning new topics** - From programming languages to cooking techniques to career advice
- **Problem-solving** - Working through challenges, debugging issues, brainstorming solutions
- **Sharing context** - Explaining your situation, constraints, goals, and preferences
- **Tracking what works** - Discovering which approaches resonate with you and which don't
- **Building knowledge** - Accumulating insights, decisions, and understanding over time

All of this context—months or years of conversations—shapes how the AI should help you. It reveals:

- Your **skill level** in different areas (not just "knows Python" but _how_ you think about code)
- Your **learning patterns** (learn best through examples? struggle with abstract concepts?)
- Your **strengths and gaps** (confident with frontend, less familiar with databases)
- Your **communication style** (prefer detailed explanations or quick answers?)
- Your **background knowledge** (what analogies will click for you?)

### Context is Everything

There's a saying in AI: **"garbage in, garbage out."** The AI is only as good as the information it receives.

Chat History Memory enables what's often called **context engineering**—making the best possible information available to the AI. Instead of just knowing facts about you, the AI can draw on actual conversations that show your thought process, struggles, breakthroughs, and preferences.

## How It Works

Chat History Memory can be added in two ways:

### Upload Chat Exports (Recommended for Initial Import)

Export your chat history as JSON files from ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind and upload them to MemoryPlugin. This is the fastest way to import your entire history. Processing happens automatically in the background.

### Online Sync (Beta)

For ChatGPT and Claude, we can sync your conversations directly from your account without needing to download files. Designed for keeping new and updated conversations in sync automatically after your initial import. This handles small incremental updates in the background, so you never have to manually export again. Can take longer for large initial imports (several days vs. a few hours), but works as a fallback if you're unable to export JSON files.

<Note>
  Online sync is **opt-in only**. Chats are never uploaded or synced without
  your explicit permission.
</Note>

Once imported, you can search your chat history and relevant context is automatically added to new conversations via our Browser Extension or MCP Server.

## Platform Support

### Using Chat History (Read)

Once you've imported your chat history, **all platforms** supported by our [Browser Extension](/integrations/browser-extension) and [MCP Server](/integrations/mcp-server) can use it as context:

ChatGPT • Claude • Gemini • Google AI Studio • Grok • Poe • DeepSeek • Qwen • And more...

MemoryPlugin can surface relevant past conversations as context in your new chats—no matter which AI platform you're using.

### Importing Chat History (Write)

Currently, you can import chat history from these platforms:

- **ChatGPT** (JSON export or online sync)
- **Claude** (JSON export or online sync)
- **TypingMind** (JSON export)

<Info>
  Platform support is limited but growing. We're working on expanding import
  support to more platforms and file formats (Markdown, PDF, etc.) based on user
  requests. [Request your platform](https://feedback.memoryplugin.com)
