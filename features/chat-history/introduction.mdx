## What is Chat History Memory?

Chat History Memory gives MemoryPlugin the ability to remember **every conversation** you've ever had with your AI tools—not just snippets, but complete discussions spanning months or years.

### How It's Different from Regular Memory

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Regular Memory" icon="note-sticky">
    Small snippets of key information
    - Your name and preferences
    - Project details
    - Important facts

    Like a rulebook the AI always refers to
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat History Memory" icon="rectangle-history">
    Complete conversation history
    - Every question and answer
    - Full discussion context
    - Decisions and reasoning

    Like the AI having perfect recall of everything you've discussed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Both types of memory work together—Regular Memory for instant access to key facts, Chat History Memory for deep conversational context.

## Why It Matters

Your chat history contains invaluable context:

- **Months or years** of conversations
- **Shared information** and background context
- **Project evolution** and discussion history
- **Decisions made** and their rationale
- **Progress tracked** over time
- **Learning and insights** gained

This wealth of information helps AI tools become:
- **More personalized** - Understanding your communication style
- **More relevant** - Drawing on past context automatically
- **More helpful** - Building on previous discussions instead of starting from scratch

<Info>
The difference is like handing someone your business card versus working with a colleague who's been in every meeting with you for years.

## Privacy and Security

Your chat history may contain sensitive information. We take our responsibility seriously.

## How It Works

Chat History Memory can be added in two ways:

### Upload Chat Exports (Recommended for Initial Import)
Export your chat history as JSON files from ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind and upload them to MemoryPlugin. This is the fastest way to import your entire history. Processing happens automatically in the background.

### Online Import (Beta)
For ChatGPT and Claude, we can import your conversations directly from your account without needing to download files. Best for keeping new and updated conversations in sync after your initial import. Can be much slower for importing your entire history, but works as a fallback if you're unable to export JSON files.

Once imported, you can search your chat history and relevant context is automatically added to new conversations via our Browser Extension or MCP Server.

## Platform Support

### Works on All Platforms

Once you've imported your chat history, it's available on **all platforms** supported by our [Browser Extension](/integrations/browser-extension) and [MCP Server](/integrations/mcp-server):

ChatGPT • Claude • Gemini • Google AI Studio • Grok • Poe • DeepSeek • Qwen • And more...

MemoryPlugin can surface relevant past conversations as context in your new chats—no matter which AI platform you're using.

### Import Support (Where You Can Get Your Chats From)

Currently, you can import chat history from:

- **ChatGPT**
- **Claude**
- **TypingMind**

<Info>
We're expanding import support to more platforms based on user requests. [Request your platform](https://feedback.memoryplugin.com)
