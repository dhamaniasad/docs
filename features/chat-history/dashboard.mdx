The Chat History dashboard has four main tabs for managing and using your conversation history.

## Uploads Tab

Manage your chat history imports and monitor processing status.

### Uploading a File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Platform">
    Choose which platform you're importing from: ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Import Limit (Optional)">
    Decide how many chats to import from the file:

    - **100, 200, 500, or 1,000 chats** - Quick preset options
    - **All chats** - Import everything (Pro users only)
    - **Custom amount** - Enter a specific number

    <Info>
    **Core plan**: You can import up to 500 searchable chats total. Choose a limit to stay within your quota.

    **Pro plan**: Unlimited chats. Import as many as you want.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload File">
    Drag and drop your JSON file or click **"Browse files"** to select it

    - Maximum file size: 500 MB
    - Files over 100 MB will show a warning but still work
    - Only JSON files are accepted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Processing starts automatically. You can:
    - See progress percentage
    - View number of messages processed
    - Close the tab—processing continues in the background
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why Use Import Limits?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stay within your plan quota" icon="gauge">
    Core users have a limit of 500 searchable chats. Importing only recent conversations keeps you within quota. You can always import more later or upgrade to Pro for unlimited.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on recent conversations" icon="clock">
    If you only care about recent context, there's no need to process years of old chats. Import what matters most.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test the feature first" icon="flask">
    Start with 100 chats to see how Chat History Memory works, then import more once you're comfortable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Managing Imports

Each upload shows:
- **Filename** and platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind)
- **Status**: Queued, Processing, Completed, or Failed
- **Progress**: Percentage complete and message count
- **Actions**: Delete button to remove the entire import

<Warning>
Deleting an import removes all conversations from that upload, including from search and your Chats list. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Chats Tab

Browse, organize, and manage your uploaded conversations.

### Viewing Your Chats

All your uploaded conversations appear here in a searchable list showing:
- **Conversation title**
- **Date** of the conversation
- **Platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind)
- **Message count**
- **Pin status** (if pinned)

Click any conversation to view the full chat history with all messages.

### Filtering Conversations

Find specific chats using filters:

- **By platform** - Show only ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or all
- **By date range** - Filter to specific time periods
- **By title search** - Search for keywords in conversation titles
- **Show only pinned** - See just your pinned favorites

Results are paginated at 25 chats per page.

### Managing Individual Chats

Each conversation has several actions available:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin / Unpin" icon="thumbtack">
    **Pin important conversations** to keep them at the top of your list for quick access.

    Great for:
    - Frequently referenced discussions
    - Important project conversations
    - Key decision-making chats

    Pinned chats appear first in your list with a pin icon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Open in Original Platform" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    **Click to view the conversation** in its original platform (ChatGPT.com or Claude.ai).

    Note: This only works if the conversation still exists on that platform and you're logged in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude from Indexing" icon="eye-slash" id="excluding-chats">
    **Exclude specific conversations** from search and context injection while keeping them stored.

    When you exclude a chat:
    - ✅ It remains in your Chats list
    - ❌ It won't appear in search results
    - ❌ It won't be injected as context
    - ✅ It doesn't count toward your quota

    **Why exclude chats?**
    - Free up quota space on Core plan without deleting
    - Hide personal conversations from appearing in work context
    - Remove outdated discussions that aren't useful anymore
    - Keep chats for reference but not active use

    <Info>
    Exclusion is perfect for managing your 500-chat quota on the Core plan. Exclude old chats to make room for new ones without losing them.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete Permanently" icon="trash">
    **Permanently delete conversations** you don't want to keep.

    When you delete a chat:
    - It's removed from all systems immediately
    - It's deleted from backups after 30 days
    - This action cannot be undone

    **Delete vs Exclude:**
    - **Exclude** if you might want it later or just want to free quota
    - **Delete** if you never want to see it again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search Tab

Perform powerful searches across your entire chat history.

### How to Search

1. **Enter your query** in natural language (e.g., "discussions about authentication")
2. **Apply filters** (optional):
   - Platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or all)
   - Date range
3. **Adjust settings** (optional):
   - Context window size (1-30 chunks)
   - Enable/disable reranking
4. **View results** with matched content and surrounding context

### Search Features

- **Natural language** - No boolean operators needed, just ask naturally
- **Finds related concepts** - Not just keyword matching, understands meaning
- **Shows context** - See messages before and after the matched content
- **Relevance ranked** - Best matches appear first
- **View full conversation** - Click any result to open the complete chat

### Search Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific but natural" icon="message-question">
    ✅ Good: "discussions about implementing JWT authentication"

    ❌ Avoid: "auth AND jwt OR security"

    Use natural language—the system understands context better than boolean operators.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use date filters for recent topics" icon="calendar">
    If you remember roughly when a conversation happened, narrow down results with the date range filter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust context window for more/less surrounding text" icon="window">
    - **Small (1-5 chunks)**: Precise matches only
    - **Medium (6-15 chunks)**: Balanced context
    - **Large (16-30 chunks)**: Maximum surrounding conversation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Try rephrasing if needed" icon="rotate">
    If you don't find what you're looking for, try asking the same thing in different words. The search understands multiple ways of expressing the same concept.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by platform" icon="filter">
    If you remember which AI you were chatting with, filter to just that platform for faster results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding Results

Each search result shows:
- **Matched content** highlighted in context
- **Conversation title** and date
- **Platform** it came from
- **Message count** in that conversation
- **Relevance score** (higher = better match)

Click any result to view the full conversation with all messages.

<Note>
Search has a 30-second timeout. If your query times out, try being more specific or using date filters to narrow the scope.
</Note>

## Ask Tab

Ask questions and get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history.

### How It Works

1. **Ask a question** in natural language about your chat history
2. **AI searches** for relevant conversations automatically
3. **Get a comprehensive answer** with citations to source conversations
4. **Follow up** with related questions

### What You Can Ask

The AI can answer questions like:

- "What have I discussed about authentication strategies?"
- "Show me all conversations about the UserProfile component"
- "What decisions did I make about database architecture?"
- "Summarize my discussions about API design patterns"
- "What feedback did I receive on my pricing page redesign?"

### Understanding Answers

Each answer includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synthesized Response" icon="message">
    A comprehensive answer (typically 500+ words) drawing from multiple conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Source Citations" icon="quote-left">
    References to specific conversations where information was found
  </Card>

    Relevant excerpts from the cited conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confidence Indicators" icon="gauge">
    How certain the AI is about the answer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Features

- **Multi-step reasoning** - The AI can search multiple times to find complete answers
- **Automatic tool use** - Searches by keywords, topics, and timeframes as needed
- **Context-aware** - Understands your question and retrieves the most relevant information
- **Comprehensive synthesis** - Combines information from multiple sources into one answer

<Warning>
The Ask feature can take 30-120 seconds for complex queries as it searches and analyzes your history. Be patient while it works.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Failed or Stuck" icon="circle-exclamation">
