The Chat History dashboard has four main tabs for managing and using your conversation history.

## Uploads Tab

Monitor and manage your chat history imports.

![Uploads Tab Overview](/images/chat-history/uploads-page-overview.png)

### Viewing Imports

Each upload shows:

- **Filename** and platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind)
- **Status**: Queued, Processing, Completed, or Failed
- **Progress**: Percentage complete and message count
- **Actions**: Delete button to remove the entire import

![Upload List](/images/chat-history/uploads-page-list.png)

### Processing Status

Processing happens automatically in the background with periodic progress updates. You can:

- See progress percentage
- View number of messages processed
- Close the tab—processing continues in the background
- Large files can take several minutes to hours

### Deleting Imports

<Warning>
  Deleting an import removes all conversations from that upload, including from
  search and your Chats list. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Chats Tab

Browse, organize, and manage your uploaded conversations.

### Viewing Your Chats

All your uploaded conversations appear here in a searchable list showing:

- **Conversation title**
- **Date of last message** in the conversation
- **Import time**
- **Platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind)
- **Message count**
- **Pin status** (if pinned)

Click any conversation to view the full chat history with all messages.

### Filtering Conversations

Find specific chats using filters:

- **By platform** - Show only ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or all
- **By date range** - Filter to specific time periods
- **By title** - Keyword search in conversation titles
- **Show only pinned** - See just your pinned favorites

You can also select multiple chats for bulk actions:

![Bulk Chat Actions](/images/chat-history/chats-page-bulk-actions.png)

### Managing Individual Chats

Each conversation has several actions available:

![Individual Chat Actions](/images/chat-history/chat-page-chat-actions.png)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin / Unpin" icon="thumbtack">
    **Pin important conversations** to protect them from accidental deletion.

    Pinned chats:
    - Are protected from deletion — must be unpinned before they can be deleted
    - Display a pin icon in your chat list
    - Can be filtered using the "Pinned only" filter to quickly see your important chats
    - **For Core Plan users**: Help ensure important conversations aren't removed when managing your 500-chat quota
    - **Coming soon**: Will receive higher priority in search results

    To delete a pinned chat:
    1. Click the pin icon or action menu to unpin it
    2. Then you can delete it using the delete action or bulk deletion

    Great for frequently referenced discussions and critical project conversations.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Open in Original Platform" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    **Click to view the conversation** in its original platform (ChatGPT.com or Claude.ai).

    Works with all supported platforms. Requirements:
    - You're logged in to the correct account on that platform
    - The conversation hasn't been deleted from the platform

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude from Indexing" icon="eye-slash" id="excluding-chats">
    **Exclude specific conversations** to delete their data while preventing them from being automatically re-processed in future imports.

    When you exclude a chat:
    - ✅ A placeholder entry remains in your Chats list (marked as excluded, with title only)
    - ❌ All conversation data is permanently deleted from the database
    - ❌ It won't appear in search results
    - ❌ It won't be injected as context
    - ✅ It doesn't count toward your quota
    - ✅ If you enable online sync or re-import the same JSON file, this chat will be automatically skipped

    **Why exclude chats?**
    - Free up quota space on Core plan (each exclusion frees one slot)
    - Permanently remove sensitive conversations you don't want processed
    - Prevent specific chats from being auto-synced via Browser Extension
    - Delete data you don't want searchable or used as context

    <Info>
    Exclusion is perfect for managing your 500-chat quota on the Core plan. Exclude old or unwanted chats to make room for new ones. The placeholder ensures they won't be re-imported automatically.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete Permanently" icon="trash">
    **Permanently delete conversations** you don't want to keep.

    When you delete a chat:
    - It's removed from all systems immediately
    - It's deleted from backups after 30 days
    - This action cannot be undone
    - **Important**: Deleted chats can come back in future imports (online sync or JSON re-imports)

    **Delete vs Exclude:**
    - **Exclude** if you want to prevent the chat from being processed in future imports
    - **Delete** if you just want to remove it now but don't mind if it comes back later

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search Tab

Perform powerful searches across your entire chat history to find specific conversations.

![Search Results](/images/chat-history/chat-history-search-results.png)

### How It Works

Search uses **hybrid search** combining semantic understanding with keyword matching to find the most relevant conversations across thousands of chats. Each result includes a summary explaining why the chat matched your query and what it discusses.

### How to Search

1. Go to the **Search tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Enter your query in natural language (e.g., "discussions about authentication")
3. Apply optional filters (platform, date range)
4. View results with summaries, matched content, and conversation details
5. Click any result to open the full conversation

### Search Features

- **Hybrid search** - Combines semantic understanding with keyword matching for best results
- **Natural language queries** - No boolean operators needed, just ask naturally
- **Temporal queries** - Understands time references like "last year", "last month", "in 2024" and automatically filters to the correct time periods
- **Result summaries** - Each result shows why it matched and what the conversation discusses
- **Relevance ranking** - Best matches appear first
- **Platform filtering** - Search across all platforms or filter by ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind
- **View full conversation** - Click any result to open the complete chat

### Search Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific but natural" icon="message-question">
    ✅ Good: "discussions about implementing JWT authentication"

    ✅ Good: "discussions about vacation plans last year"

    ❌ Avoid: "auth AND jwt OR security"

    Use natural language—the system understands context better than boolean operators. You can include time references directly in your query.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use temporal queries" icon="clock">
    Include time references in your queries to automatically filter results:
    - "conversations about the project last month"
    - "feedback I received in 2024"
    - "discussions from last year"

    The search automatically interprets these time references and finds chats from the correct time periods.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Try rephrasing if needed" icon="rotate">
  If you don't find what you're looking for, try asking the same thing in
  different words.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by platform" icon="filter">
    If you remember which AI you were chatting with, filter to just that platform for faster results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding Results

Each search result shows:

- **Summary** explaining why the chat matched and what it discusses
- **Conversation title**
- **Platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind)

Click any result to view the full conversation with all messages.

## Ask Tab

Get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history. **Much more powerful than Search** for finding information.

**Search vs Ask:**

- **Search tab** → Find specific conversations
- **Ask tab** → Get answers from your chat history

![Ask Feature](/images/chat-history/chat-history-ask.png)

### How It Works

Ask uses **agentic multi-step retrieval** to answer your questions:

1. **Initial search** - Searches your chat history for relevant conversations
2. **Intelligent exploration** - AI decides whether to search again with different queries, dig deeper into specific chats, or fetch additional context
3. **Multi-round searches** - Can perform up to 5 searches, refining based on what it learns
4. **Comprehensive synthesis** - Combines information from multiple conversations into a detailed answer (typically 500+ words)

The AI automatically determines what information to retrieve and from where, searching across different time periods, topics, and contexts as needed.

<Note>
  The Ask feature is actively being improved. We're continuously enhancing its
  ability to find and synthesize information from your chat history.
</Note>

### How to Use

1. Go to the **Ask tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Ask a question in natural language about your chat history
3. Wait while the AI searches and analyzes (can take 30-120 seconds)
4. Get a comprehensive answer with citations to source conversations
5. Follow up with related questions

### Example Questions

- "What have I discussed about authentication strategies?"
- "Show me all conversations about the UserProfile component"
- "What decisions did I make about database architecture?"
- "Summarize my discussions about API design patterns"
- "What feedback did I receive on my pricing page redesign?"

### Understanding Answers

Each answer includes:

- **Comprehensive synthesis** - Detailed response (3-6 paragraphs) directly answering your question
- **Citations** - References to specific conversations in the format: "In 'Chat Title' on YYYY-MM-DD, ..."
- **Supporting quotes** - Key excerpts from the cited conversations (3-8 short items)
- **Code snippets** - Preserved when relevant to the answer

<Warning>
  Complex queries can take 30-120 seconds as the AI performs multiple searches
  and analyzes your history. Be patient while it works.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Failed or Stuck" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms**: Upload doesn't start, shows error, or stays at 0%

    **Solutions**:
    - Try reuploading the file
    - If the issue persists after a few hours, contact support with a screenshot
    - Check file size (must be under 500 MB)
    - Verify file is valid JSON
    - Ensure file is from supported platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Processing Takes Too Long" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms**: Processing status doesn't update, seems stuck

    **Solutions**:
    - Large files can take several minutes to hours
    - Check the Uploads tab for current status
    - Processing continues in the background—you can close the tab
    - If stuck for over 24 hours, contact support with a screenshot

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search Returns No Results" icon="magnifying-glass-minus">
    **Symptoms**: Search doesn't find expected conversations

    **Solutions**:
    - Wait for your first import to be completely processed
    - Try different phrasings of your query
    - Remove date filters and search again
    - Check if the chat was excluded from indexing
    - Try broader search terms

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Excluded Chats Still Appearing" icon="eye">
    **Symptoms**: Excluded conversations show up in your Chats list or search results

    **Solutions**:
    - Exclusion might take a while to take effect—wait a few minutes and refresh
    - It's possible another chat has similar content and is appearing in results
    - Verify the exclusion was saved (excluded chats show as "excluded" in the Chats tab)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reached Import Limit" icon="gauge-high">
    **Symptoms**: Can't import more chats on Core plan

    **Solutions**:
    - **Exclude old chats** you don't need from the Chats tab (frees quota)
    - **Delete imports** you no longer need from the Uploads tab
    - **Upgrade to Pro** for unlimited chats

    Each excluded chat frees up one slot in your 500-chat quota.
