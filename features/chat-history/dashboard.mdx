The Chat History dashboard has four main tabs for managing and using your conversation history.

## Uploads Tab

Monitor and manage your chat history imports.

![Uploads Tab Overview](/images/chat-history/uploads-page-overview.png)

### Viewing Imports

Each upload shows:
- **Filename** and platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind)
- **Status**: Queued, Processing, Completed, or Failed
- **Progress**: Percentage complete and message count
- **Actions**: Delete button to remove the entire import

![Upload List](/images/chat-history/uploads-page-list.png)

### Processing Status

Processing happens automatically in the background. You can:
- See progress percentage
- View number of messages processed
- Close the tab—processing continues in the background
- Large files can take several minutes to hours

### Deleting Imports

<Warning>
Deleting an import removes all conversations from that upload, including from search and your Chats list. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Chats Tab

Browse, organize, and manage your uploaded conversations.

### Viewing Your Chats

All your uploaded conversations appear here in a searchable list showing:
- **Conversation title**
- **Date** of the conversation
- **Platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind)
- **Message count**
- **Pin status** (if pinned)

Click any conversation to view the full chat history with all messages.

### Filtering Conversations

Find specific chats using filters:

- **By platform** - Show only ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or all
- **By date range** - Filter to specific time periods
- **By title search** - Search for keywords in conversation titles
- **Show only pinned** - See just your pinned favorites

You can also select multiple chats for bulk actions:

![Bulk Chat Actions](/images/chat-history/chats-page-bulk-actions.png)

### Managing Individual Chats

Each conversation has several actions available:

![Individual Chat Actions](/images/chat-history/chat-page-chat-actions.png)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin / Unpin" icon="thumbtack">
    **Pin important conversations** to keep them at the top of your list for quick access.

    Great for:
    - Frequently referenced discussions
    - Important project conversations
    - Key decision-making chats

    Pinned chats appear first in your list with a pin icon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Open in Original Platform" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    **Click to view the conversation** in its original platform (ChatGPT.com or Claude.ai).

    Note: This only works if the conversation still exists on that platform and you're logged in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude from Indexing" icon="eye-slash" id="excluding-chats">
    **Exclude specific conversations** to remove their data while preventing them from being re-imported in the future.

    When you exclude a chat:
    - ✅ A placeholder remains in your Chats list (marked as excluded)
    - ❌ All conversation data is deleted from the database
    - ❌ It won't appear in search results
    - ❌ It won't be injected as context
    - ✅ It doesn't count toward your quota
    - ✅ It won't be re-processed if you import the same file again

    **Why exclude chats?**
    - Free up quota space on Core plan without fully deleting (keeps placeholder)
    - Remove unwanted conversations from future imports
    - Delete data you don't want searchable or used as context
    - Prevent automatic re-processing of specific chats

    <Info>
    Exclusion is perfect for managing your 500-chat quota on the Core plan. Exclude old chats to make room for new ones. The placeholder prevents them from being re-imported automatically.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete Permanently" icon="trash">
    **Permanently delete conversations** you don't want to keep.

    When you delete a chat:
    - It's removed from all systems immediately
    - It's deleted from backups after 30 days
    - This action cannot be undone

    **Delete vs Exclude:**
    - **Exclude** if you might want it later or just want to free quota
    - **Delete** if you never want to see it again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search Tab

Perform powerful semantic searches across your entire chat history.

### How to Search

1. Go to the **Search tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Enter your query in natural language (e.g., "discussions about authentication")
3. Apply optional filters (platform, date range)
4. Adjust settings (context window size, reranking)
5. View results with matched content and surrounding context

![Search Results](/images/chat-history/chat-history-search-results.png)

### Search Features

- **Natural language** - No boolean operators needed, just ask naturally
- **Semantic understanding** - Finds conceptually related content, not just keywords
- **Temporal queries** - Understands time references like "last year", "last month", "in 2024" and automatically filters to the correct time periods
- **Context windows** - See messages before and after matched content
- **Relevance ranking** - Best matches appear first
- **Platform filtering** - Search across all or filter by ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind
- **View full conversation** - Click any result to open the complete chat

### Search Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific but natural" icon="message-question">
    ✅ Good: "discussions about implementing JWT authentication"

    ✅ Good: "discussions about vacation plans last year"

    ❌ Avoid: "auth AND jwt OR security"

    Use natural language—the system understands context better than boolean operators. You can include time references directly in your query.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use temporal queries" icon="clock">
    Include time references in your queries to automatically filter results:
    - "conversations about the project last month"
    - "feedback I received in 2024"
    - "discussions from last year"

    The search automatically interprets these time references and finds chats from the correct time periods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust context window" icon="window">
    - **Small (1-5 chunks)**: Precise matches only
    - **Medium (6-15 chunks)**: Balanced context
    - **Large (16-30 chunks)**: Maximum surrounding conversation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Try rephrasing if needed" icon="rotate">
    If you don't find what you're looking for, try asking the same thing in different words.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by platform" icon="filter">
    If you remember which AI you were chatting with, filter to just that platform for faster results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding Results

Each search result shows:
- Matched content highlighted in context
- Conversation title and date
- Platform it came from
- Message count in that conversation
- Relevance score (higher = better match)

Click any result to view the full conversation with all messages.

<Note>
Search has a 30-second timeout. If your query times out, try being more specific or using date filters to narrow the scope.
</Note>

## Ask Tab

Ask natural language questions and get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history.

**Search vs Ask:**
- **Search tab** = Find specific chats
- **Ask tab** = Get answers from years of conversations

![Ask Feature](/images/chat-history/chat-history-ask.png)

### How to Use

1. Go to the **Ask tab** in your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history)
2. Ask a question in natural language about your chat history
3. The AI performs agentic lookups across your conversations
4. Get a comprehensive answer with citations to source conversations
5. Follow up with related questions

### Example Questions

- "What have I discussed about authentication strategies?"
- "Show me all conversations about the UserProfile component"
- "What decisions did I make about database architecture?"
- "Summarize my discussions about API design patterns"
- "What feedback did I receive on my pricing page redesign?"

### How It Works

The Ask feature uses agentic multi-stage retrieval to generate detailed answers from years of chat history:

- **Multi-step reasoning** - Performs multiple searches to find complete answers
- **Agentic lookups** - Automatically determines what information to retrieve and from where
- **Multi-stage retrieval** - Searches across different time periods, topics, and contexts as needed
- **Context-aware synthesis** - Understands your question and combines information from multiple conversations
- **Comprehensive answers** - Generates detailed responses (typically 500+ words) drawing from years of history

### Understanding Answers

Each answer includes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Synthesized Response" icon="message">
    Comprehensive answer drawing from multiple conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Source Citations" icon="quote-left">
    References to specific conversations where information was found
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Snippets" icon="align-left">
    Relevant excerpts from the cited conversations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
The Ask feature can take 30-120 seconds for complex queries as it searches and analyzes your history. Be patient while it works.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Failed or Stuck" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms**: Upload doesn't start, shows error, or stays at 0%

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Excluded Chats Still Appearing" icon="eye">
    **Symptoms**: Excluded conversations show up in your Chats list

    **Solutions**:
    - Exclusion takes a few minutes to take effect
