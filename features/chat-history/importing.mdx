## Getting Your Chat History

You can add chat history to MemoryPlugin in two ways:

**Option 1: Upload Chat Exports** (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind) — **Recommended for initial import**

Export your chat history as JSON files and upload them. This is the fastest way to import your entire history.

**Option 2: Online Import** (ChatGPT, Claude - Beta)

Import conversations directly from your account without downloading files. Best for keeping new and updated conversations in sync after your initial import. Can be much slower for importing your entire history, but works as a fallback if you're unable to export JSON files.

## Managing Import Quota

<Info>
**Core plan**: Up to 500 searchable chats total

**Pro plan**: Unlimited chats
</Info>

### Why Use Import Limits?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stay within your plan quota" icon="gauge">
    Core users have a limit of 500 searchable chats. Importing only recent conversations keeps you within quota. You can always import more later or upgrade to Pro for unlimited.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on recent conversations" icon="clock">
    If you only care about recent context, there's no need to process years of old chats. Import what matters most.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test the feature first" icon="flask">
    Start with 100 chats to see how Chat History Memory works, then import more once you're comfortable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Uploads Tab

Monitor and manage your chat history imports.

### Viewing Imports

Each upload shows:
- **Filename** and platform (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind)
- **Status**: Queued, Processing, Completed, or Failed
- **Progress**: Percentage complete and message count
- **Actions**: Delete button to remove the entire import

### Deleting Imports

<Warning>
Deleting an import removes all conversations from that upload, including from search and your Chats list. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Chats Tab

Browse, organize, and manage your uploaded conversations.

### Viewing Your Chats

All your uploaded conversations appear here in a searchable list showing:
- **Conversation title**
- **Date** of the conversation
- **Platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind)
- **Message count**
- **Pin status** (if pinned)

Click any conversation to view the full chat history with all messages.

### Filtering Conversations

Find specific chats using filters:

- **By platform** - Show only ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or all
- **By date range** - Filter to specific time periods
- **By title search** - Search for keywords in conversation titles
- **Show only pinned** - See just your pinned favorites

Results are paginated at 25 chats per page.

### Managing Individual Chats

Each conversation has several actions available:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin / Unpin" icon="thumbtack">
    **Pin important conversations** to keep them at the top of your list for quick access.

    Great for:
    - Frequently referenced discussions
    - Important project conversations
    - Key decision-making chats

    Pinned chats appear first in your list with a pin icon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Open in Original Platform" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square">
    **Click to view the conversation** in its original platform (ChatGPT.com or Claude.ai).

    Note: This only works if the conversation still exists on that platform and you're logged in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude from Indexing" icon="eye-slash" id="excluding-chats">
    **Exclude specific conversations** from search and context injection while keeping them stored.

    When you exclude a chat:
    - ✅ It remains in your Chats list
    - ❌ It won't appear in search results
    - ❌ It won't be injected as context
    - ✅ It doesn't count toward your quota

    **Why exclude chats?**
    - Free up quota space on Core plan without deleting
    - Hide personal conversations from appearing in work context
    - Remove outdated discussions that aren't useful anymore
    - Keep chats for reference but not active use

    <Info>
    Exclusion is perfect for managing your 500-chat quota on the Core plan. Exclude old chats to make room for new ones without losing them.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete Permanently" icon="trash">
    **Permanently delete conversations** you don't want to keep.

    When you delete a chat:
    - It's removed from all systems immediately
    - It's deleted from backups after 30 days
    - This action cannot be undone

    **Delete vs Exclude:**
    - **Exclude** if you might want it later or just want to free quota
    - **Delete** if you never want to see it again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
