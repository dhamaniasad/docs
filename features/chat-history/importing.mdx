## Getting Your Chat History

You can add chat history to MemoryPlugin in two ways:

**Option 1: Upload Chat Exports** (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind) — **Recommended for initial import**

Export your chat history as JSON files and upload them. This is the fastest way to import your entire history.

**Option 2: Online Import** (ChatGPT, Claude - Beta)

Import conversations directly from your account without downloading files. Designed for keeping new and updated conversations in sync automatically after your initial import. This handles small incremental updates in the background, so you never have to manually export again. Can take longer for large initial imports (several days vs. a few hours), but works as a fallback if you're unable to export JSON files.

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 500 MB
- **Format**: JSON only

<Info>
Have a file larger than 500 MB? [Contact us](https://memoryplugin.com) and we can help you with larger imports.
</Info>

## Uploading Your File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Navigate to your [Chat History dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard/chat-history) and open the **Uploads** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Platform">
    Choose which platform you're importing from: ChatGPT, Claude, or TypingMind
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Import Limit (Optional)">
    Decide how many chats to import from the file:

    - **100, 200, 500, or 1,000 chats** - Quick preset options
    - **All chats** - Import everything (Pro users only)
    - **Custom amount** - Enter a specific number

    <Info>
    **Core plan**: You can import up to 500 searchable chats total. Choose a limit to stay within your quota.

    **Pro plan**: Unlimited chats. Import as many as you want.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload File">
    Drag and drop your JSON file or click **"Browse files"** to select it

    - Only JSON files are accepted
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Processing starts automatically. You can monitor progress in the [Uploads tab](/features/chat-history/dashboard#uploads-tab):
    - See progress percentage
    - View number of messages processed
    - Close the tab—processing continues in the background
    - Large files can take several minutes to hours
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Don't worry about duplicates**: We automatically deduplicate chats during uploads. If you upload the same file again or import the same conversations through online import, they won't be duplicated in your chat history.
</Info>

## Managing Import Quota

<Info>
**Core plan**: Up to 500 searchable chats total

**Pro plan**: Unlimited chats
</Info>

### Why Use Import Limits?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stay within your plan quota" icon="gauge">
    Core users have a limit of 500 searchable chats. Importing only recent conversations keeps you within quota.

    **For heavy AI users**: If you've had 5,000+ conversations over 3+ years (which many heavy AI users have), we strongly recommend the Pro plan for unlimited chats and the best value. Processing large chat histories is computationally expensive, which is why Pro plan pricing reflects that cost.

    You can always import more later or upgrade to Pro for unlimited.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Focus on recent conversations" icon="clock">
    If you only care about recent context, there's no need to process years of old chats. Import what matters most.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Get started quickly" icon="rocket">
    Start with 100 chats to see how Chat History Memory works, then import more once you're comfortable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Once imported, you can manage your uploads and conversations in the [Dashboard](/features/chat-history/dashboard).
