## What is Chat History Memory?

Chat History Memory gives MemoryPlugin the ability to remember **every conversation** you've ever had with your AI tools—not just snippets, but complete discussions spanning months or years.

### How It's Different from Regular Memory

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Regular Memory" icon="note-sticky">
    Small snippets of key information
    - Your name and preferences
    - Project details
    - Important facts

    Like a rulebook the AI always refers to
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat History Memory" icon="rectangle-history">
    Complete conversation history
    - Every question and answer
    - Full discussion context
    - Decisions and reasoning

    Like the AI having perfect recall of everything you've discussed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Both types of memory work together—Regular Memory for instant access to key facts, Chat History Memory for deep conversational context.

## Why It Matters

Your chat history contains invaluable context:

- **Months or years** of conversations
- **Shared information** and background context
- **Project evolution** and discussion history
- **Decisions made** and their rationale
- **Progress tracked** over time
- **Learning and insights** gained

This wealth of information helps AI tools become:
- **More personalized** - Understanding your communication style
- **More relevant** - Drawing on past context automatically
- **More helpful** - Building on previous discussions instead of starting from scratch

<Info>
The difference is like talking to a doctor with just a few notes about you versus a close friend who remembers years of conversations.

## Privacy and Security

Your chat history may contain sensitive information. We take our responsibility seriously.

## How It Works

Chat History Memory operates in three simple stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Export your chat history from supported platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind) and upload the JSON file to MemoryPlugin.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process">
    MemoryPlugin processes your chats automatically in the background. No configuration needed—just wait for processing to complete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use">
    Your chat history becomes searchable and available to inject into new conversations via our Browser Extension or MCP Server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Import Quota

<Info>
**Import limits help you manage your quota:**
- **Core plan**: Up to 500 searchable chats
- **Pro plan**: Unlimited chats
</Info>

When uploading, you can choose how many chats to import from your export file:

- **Import all chats** - Process everything in the file (Pro users)
- **Import recent chats** - Choose a limit like 100, 200, 500, or 1,000 chats
- **Custom limit** - Specify exactly how many to import

### Why Choose a Limit?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Stay within your plan quota" icon="gauge">
    Core users have a 500-chat limit. Importing only recent conversations keeps you within quota. Pro users get unlimited chats.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude older chats you don't need" icon="filter">
    If you only want recent context, there's no need to process years of old conversations. Import what matters to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test before importing everything" icon="flask">
    Start with 100 chats to see how the feature works, then import more later if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
If you reach your import limit, you can [exclude existing chats](/features/chat-history/dashboard#excluding-chats) to free up space, or [upgrade to Pro](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard) for unlimited chats.
</Warning>

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 500 MB
- **Recommended**: Under 100 MB for best performance
- **Format**: JSON only

Files over 100 MB will show a performance warning but can still be uploaded.

<Info>
Have a file larger than 500 MB? [Contact us](https://memoryplugin.com) and we can help you with larger imports.
