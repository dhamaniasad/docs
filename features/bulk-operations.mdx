Bulk operations allow you to efficiently manage multiple memories at once, saving time and effort when organizing your memory collection.

<Note>
Bulk operations documentation was limited in the source material. This page provides expected functionality based on common patterns for memory management systems.
</Note>

## Overview

Bulk operations enable you to:
- Select multiple memories simultaneously
- Perform actions on all selected memories at once
- Save time when organizing large memory collections
- Maintain consistency across related memories

## Available Bulk Actions

### Selection Methods

### Bulk Actions

Once you've selected memories, you can:

#### Move to Bucket
Transfer multiple memories to a different bucket:
1. Select the memories you want to move
2. Click "Move to Bucket" from the bulk actions menu
3. Choose the destination bucket
4. Confirm the move

#### Delete Multiple
Remove several memories at once:
1. Select memories to delete
2. Click "Delete Selected"
3. Confirm deletion (this cannot be undone)

#### Export Selected
Export chosen memories for backup or analysis:
1. Select memories to export
2. Choose export format (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
3. Download the exported file

#### Tag Operations
Add or remove tags from multiple memories:
1. Select target memories
2. Choose "Add Tags" or "Remove Tags"
3. Specify the tags to add/remove
4. Apply changes

## Using Bulk Operations

### From the Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Memories">
    Go to the Memories section of your Dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Selection Mode">
    Click the checkbox icon or first memory's checkbox
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Memories">
    Choose individual memories or use selection helpers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Action">
    Select your desired bulk action from the toolbar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review and confirm the bulk operation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Filtering Before Bulk Operations

For more precise bulk operations:

1. **Apply Filters First**:
   - Filter by bucket
   - Search for specific terms
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by tags or categories

2. **Review Filtered Results**:
   - Ensure you have the right memories
   - Check the count of filtered items

3. **Select All Filtered**:
   - Use "Select all X memories matching filter"
   - Perform your bulk operation

## Use Cases

### Organizing After Import

After importing memories from ChatGPT:
- Select all imported memories
- Move them to a specific "ChatGPT Import" bucket
- Or distribute them across relevant project buckets

### Cleaning Up Old Memories

Periodically maintain your memory collection:
- Filter memories by date (e.g., older than 6 months)
- Review and select outdated memories
- Bulk delete irrelevant ones

### Project Reorganization

When restructuring your projects:
- Select all memories from an old project
- Move them to a new bucket structure
- Apply new tags or categories

### Preparing for Export

Before sharing or backing up:
- Select relevant memories for a project
- Export them in the required format
- Share with team members or archive

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Preview Before Action">
    Always review your selection before executing bulk operations, especially deletions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Filters Wisely">
    Combine filters to narrow down to exactly the memories you want to modify.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Small">
    When learning bulk operations, start with small batches to understand the effects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Maintenance">
    Schedule regular memory maintenance sessions using bulk operations to keep your collection organized.

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Dialogs
All destructive bulk operations require confirmation:
- Shows number of affected memories
- Describes the action to be taken
- Requires explicit confirmation

### Undo Capabilities
Some bulk operations support undo:
- Move operations can be reversed
- Tag changes can be undone
- Deletions are permanent (no undo)

### Operation Limits
To prevent accidents:
- Maximum number of memories per operation
- Timeout protection for large operations
- Progressive processing for huge batches

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up bulk operations with keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + A` | Select all visible |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` | Toggle individual selection |
| `Shift + Click` | Range selection |
| `Esc` | Clear selection |
| `Delete` | Delete selected (with confirmation) |

## Performance Tips

### For Large Collections

When working with many memories:

1. **Use Pagination**: Work with one page at a time
2. **Filter First**: Reduce the dataset before selecting
3. **Batch Processing**: Break large operations into smaller chunks
4. **Off-Peak Hours**: Perform large operations during low-usage times

### Optimization Strategies

- **Regular Cleanup**: Don't let memories accumulate unnecessarily
- **Consistent Organization**: Maintain a clear bucket structure
- **Periodic Reviews**: Schedule regular maintenance sessions
- **Archive Old Data**: Export and remove very old memories

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Selection not working">
    - Refresh the Dashboard page
    - Check if selection mode is enabled
    - Clear browser cache if persistent issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bulk action fails">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify you have permission for the action
    - Try with fewer memories selected
    - Contact support for persistent failures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operations timing out">
    - Reduce the number of selected memories
    - Try the operation in smaller batches
    - Check system status for any ongoing issues
