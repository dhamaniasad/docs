Bulk operations let you select multiple memories and perform actions on all of them at once, making it easy to organize large memory collections.

## How Bulk Operations Work

### Entering Selection Mode

1. **Go to your Dashboard** - Navigate to the Memories tab
2. **Click "Select Multiple"** - Click this button to enter selection mode
3. **Select memories** - Checkboxes now appear - click them to select memories
4. **Choose action** - Use the bulk actions toolbar that appears

### Available Operations

Once you've selected memories, you can:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Move to Bucket" icon="folder">
    Transfer selected memories to a different bucket
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete Multiple" icon="trash">
    Permanently delete all selected memories
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Selection

- **Select memories**: Click checkboxes after entering selection mode
- **Add/remove**: Click checkboxes to toggle selection
- **Cancel**: Click "Cancel Selection" to exit selection mode

## Using Bulk Operations

### Moving Memories

1. Click "Select Multiple" → select memories → click "Move to..." → choose bucket
2. Memories move immediately to the selected bucket

### Deleting Memories

1. Click "Select Multiple" → select memories → click "Delete" 
2. Confirm in the dialog - **deletion is permanent**

<Warning>
Bulk deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Double-check your selection before confirming.
</Warning>

## Tips

- **Search first** to narrow results before selecting
- **Work in batches** rather than selecting hundreds at once
- **Switch buckets** to avoid selecting from wrong bucket
- **Double-check** before deleting - it's permanent

## Current Limitations

Bulk operations do **not** support:
- Range selection (Shift+click)
- Select all functionality
- Bulk editing of memory text
