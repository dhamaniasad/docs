Import all your ChatGPT saved memories into MemoryPlugin instantly using the browser extension's sync feature.

<Info>
This imports ChatGPT's "saved memories" - the personal information ChatGPT remembers about you, not your chat conversation history.
</Info>

## What You Need

- [MemoryPlugin Browser Extension](/integrations/browser-extension) installed
- ChatGPT account with saved memories
- MemoryPlugin account (signed in)

## How to Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open ChatGPT">
    Go to ChatGPT in your browser where the extension is installed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click Settings from your profile menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Personalization">
    Click on the "Personalization" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Memories">
    Click "Manage memories" to see your saved memories

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Completion">
    The sync typically takes a couple minutes depending on how many memories you have. **Keep this browser tab open** and **don't navigate away** - closing the tab or using ChatGPT will interrupt the sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Sync

- All your ChatGPT memories are copied to MemoryPlugin
- No duplicates are created if you run sync multiple times  
- The sync runs in the browser - **don't close the tab or navigate away**
- Imported memories go to your "General" bucket by default

## After Import

1. **Check your dashboard** - Go to [memoryplugin.com/dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard) to see your imported memories
2. **Organize if needed** - Move memories to different [buckets](/features/memory-buckets) for better organization
3. **Use across platforms** - Your ChatGPT memories now work with Claude, Gemini, and other AI platforms

## Common Issues
