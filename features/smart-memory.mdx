<Note>
Smart Memory is currently in Beta and available for all users, rolling out gradually across the platform.
</Note>

Smart Memory is an AI-powered organizational system that automatically categorizes your memories into meaningful groups for more efficient and relevant AI interactions.

## The Problem Smart Memory Solves

Until recently, MemoryPlugin operated as a simple list. You would add new memories to the list, and the entire list would be shared with the AI when required. While this is useful, it has significant limitations:

  <Card title="Irrelevant Information" icon="filter">
    Dumping the entire memory list feeds tons of irrelevant information to the AI, potentially reducing performance by confusing the model
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Window Bloat" icon="window-maximize">
    Not every conversation needs full details of every memory. As you add more memories, they take up more space, leaving less room for your actual work
  </Card>
  <Card title="Higher Costs" icon="dollar-sign">
    All API-based tools charge by the token, so more information in the context window means higher costs and faster rate limiting

## What is Smart Memory?

Smart Memory automatically analyzes and organizes your memories into intelligent categories with AI-generated summaries.

### How It Works

Smart Memory operates at the [Memory Bucket](/features/memory-buckets) level:

1. **Analysis**: AI analyzes all memories within a bucket to identify themes and patterns
2. **Categorization**: Groups related memories into meaningful categories like "Work Projects", "Learning Goals", "Health & Wellness"
3. **Summarization**: Creates concise summaries for each category 
4. **Selective Loading**: AI can load specific categories relevant to the conversation context

<Info>
Instead of loading all memories, the AI can focus on just the categories relevant to your conversation, making interactions more efficient and contextual.
</Info>

## Benefits

### Better Context Efficiency
Smart Memory improves AI interactions by:
- Loading only relevant memory categories instead of everything
- Providing focused context that matches your conversation topic
- Preserving context window space for actual conversation

### Improved Organization
- **Automatic categorization**: AI identifies themes and groups related memories
- **Clear summaries**: Each category gets a concise overview of its contents
- **Easy filtering**: Focus on specific categories in the dashboard

### Enhanced Scalability  
- **Handle more memories**: Categories keep large collections organized and accessible
- **Maintain performance**: Selective loading prevents information overload
- **Better relevance**: AI gets context that actually matters for the conversation

## How Smart Memory Categories Work

### Category Creation
Smart Memory analyzes your memories to create categories:

```
Bucket: "Personal Development"
├── Work Projects (12 memories)
│   Summary: "Current job responsibilities, team meetings, project updates..."
├── Health & Fitness (8 memories)  
│   Summary: "Exercise routines, nutrition goals, health tracking..."
└── Learning Goals (15 memories)
    Summary: "Programming courses, book notes, skill development..."
```

### Requirements and Limits
- **Minimum**: 30 memories required in a bucket for categorization
- **Maximum**: Works with buckets up to 600,000 tokens or 2,000 memories
- **Manual Process**: Categories must be created by clicking the dashboard button

## Using Smart Memory

### Getting Started
Smart Memory requires manual activation in your dashboard:

1. **Add 30+ memories** to any bucket
2. **Click "Create Smart Categories"** button in the dashboard 
3. **Wait for processing** (usually takes a few minutes)
4. **View your organized categories** with summaries and additional context

### In the Dashboard
Once categories are created, you can:
- **Browse categories**: Each shows a summary and additional information
- **Filter by category**: Focus on specific themes
- **Refresh categories**: Click the refresh button to update organization
- **View memory counts**: See how many memories are in each category

### Category Information
Each category provides multiple layers of information:

- **Category Name**: AI-generated theme (e.g., "Work Projects", "Health Goals")
- **Summary**: High-level overview of what memories in this category contain
- **Additional Information**: Deeper context about the category's contents, including:
  - Key topics and themes within the category
  - Specific details that distinguish this category from others
  - Context that helps AI assistants understand when this category is relevant
  - More granular information about the types of memories included
- **Memory Count**: Number of memories grouped in this category

The **Additional Information** field is particularly useful for AI interactions - it provides context that helps determine when to load this category's memories during conversations, making the AI's responses more accurate and relevant.

## Availability

Smart Memory is currently in Beta and rolling out gradually to all users.

### With AI Integrations
Once you have Smart Memory categories set up:

- **Browser Extension**: Categories are available when using AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- **MCP Server**: Smart Memory integration is being developed for MCP-compatible clients
- **Custom GPT**: Smart Memory integration is planned for future development
- **API**: Smart Memory endpoints are currently internal-only

## Use Cases

Smart Memory is particularly valuable for:

### Power Users
- Large memory collections (hundreds or thousands of memories)
- Multiple complex projects with extensive documentation
- Long-term AI assistance relationships with deep context

### Professional Applications
- Customer service with extensive customer history
- Consulting work with detailed client information
- Research projects with vast amounts of collected information

### Cost-Conscious Users
- High-volume API usage where token costs matter
- Rate-limited environments where efficiency is crucial
- Performance-sensitive applications

## Example Categories

Smart Memory might organize your memories into categories like:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Work Projects" icon="briefcase">
    Meeting notes, project updates, deadlines, team communications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Health & Wellness" icon="heart">
    Exercise routines, nutrition goals, medical appointments, wellness tracking
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learning & Development" icon="book">
    Course notes, tutorials, skill development, book summaries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Personal Goals" icon="target">
    Life goals, habit tracking, personal reflections, milestone planning
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Comparison: Traditional vs Smart Memory

| Aspect | Traditional Memory | Smart Memory |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Organization** | Chronological list of all memories | Themed categories with summaries |
| **Context Loading** | All memories loaded at once | Relevant categories loaded selectively |
| **Scalability** | Gets unwieldy with many memories | Stays organized regardless of size |
| **AI Relevance** | AI sees everything, relevant or not | AI gets focused, contextual information |
| **Dashboard View** | Simple memory list | Organized by categories with filtering |
