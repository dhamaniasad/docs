  <Step title="Browser Extension Installed">
    Install the [MemoryPlugin Browser Extension](/integrations/browser-extension) on Chrome or Safari

## Import Process

### Step-by-Step Guide

  <Step title="Open ChatGPT">
    Navigate to ChatGPT in your browser where the extension is installed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click on your profile icon and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Personalization">
    In the Settings menu, click on the "Personalization" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Memories">
    Click on "Manage memories" to view your ChatGPT memories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Sync Button">
    Look for the "Sync Memories" button with the MemoryPlugin logo
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Sync">
    Click the "Sync Memories" button - it will change to "Syncing..."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Completion">
    The sync typically completes in a couple of minutes depending on the number of memories
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Visual Indicators

During the import process, you'll see:

1. **Sync Button States**:
   - **"Sync Memories"** - Ready to start import
   - **"Syncing..."** - Import in progress
   - **"Sync Memories"** (returns) - Import complete

2. **Progress Feedback**:
   - The button provides visual feedback during the sync
   - You can continue using ChatGPT while syncing happens in the background

## What Gets Imported

The import process transfers:

- ✅ All your ChatGPT memories
- ✅ Memory creation timestamps (when available)
- ✅ Memory content exactly as stored in ChatGPT
- ✅ Associated context and metadata

<Info>
The import is intelligent - you can safely run the sync multiple times without creating duplicate memories.
</Info>

## Import Options

### Choosing a Target Bucket

By default, imported memories go to your "General" bucket. To organize imports:

1. Create a specific bucket for ChatGPT memories before importing
2. After import, use [bulk operations](/features/bulk-operations) to move memories
3. Or manually organize memories through the Dashboard

### Handling Large Imports

For users with many ChatGPT memories:

- **Batch Processing**: The system handles large imports in batches
- **No Timeout Issues**: Import continues even if it takes longer
- **Background Processing**: You can close the tab after starting import
- **Status Check**: Check your Dashboard to see imported memories

## Post-Import Steps

After successfully importing your memories:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Import">
    Go to your [Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard) to see imported memories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Memories">
    Check that all memories were imported correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize">
    Use [Memory Buckets](/features/memory-buckets) to organize imported memories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean Up">
    Remove any outdated or duplicate memories if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of Importing
