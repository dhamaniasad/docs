## What it is

Chat History Memory is a new feature that can remember everything you have ever discussed with your AI tools, across multiple supported AI platforms.

Before Chat History Memory, Regular Memory would store small snippets of information like your name, your preferences, information about your projects, etc., but it would not remember what you've discussed in the past.

Regular Memory has its place and will continue to be supported and improved.

## Why it's important

Regular Memory, where small snippets of text are saved, is useful for storing information that needs to always be available. It's like a rulebook your AI can always refer to.

Your Chat History might go back months or years, with countless conversations, with information shared, projects discussed, decisions made, progress tracked, etc.

This information is way too much for Regular Memory, but it provides invaluable insight to your AI tools to be more personalised, more relevant, and more helpful.

The difference is like talking to a doctor who remembers you based on a small set of notes they made about you, vs a friend who remembers the countless conversations you've had with them over the years.

## How it works

Chat History Memory works by uploading your chat history to MemoryPlugin, and then making it accessible to your AI tools via our Browser Extension and MCP Servers. 

Note: Your chats are never uploaded without your explicit permission. This feature is opt-in only, and you can continue to use MemoryPlugin without it.

## Privacy and Security

Your chats can contain sensitive information, and we take our responsibility to protect your privacy seriously. 

Here's what we do to protect your privacy:

- Your chats are never uploaded without your explicit permission. This feature requires explicit opt-in.
- We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest.
- We will never sell your data to third parties.
- Your data remains yours, and you can delete it at any time. Deletions are processed immediately. (Information stored in backups is deleted after 30 days)
- You can choose to exclude specific chats from being uploaded to MemoryPlugin.

You can read more about our commitment to privacy and security in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.memoryplugin.com/privacy-policy).

## Supported Platforms

We can break down the Chat History feature support into two categories:

- Support for reading chat history
- Support for uploading chat history

All platforms supported by our Browser Extension and MCP Servers support reading chat history. 

Support for uploading chat history is currently only available for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
We will continue to add support for more platforms in the future. If you would like to see support for a specific platform, please let us know in the [feedback form](https://feedback.memoryplugin.com).
