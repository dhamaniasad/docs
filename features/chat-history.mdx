<Note>
Chat History Memory is currently in Beta. We're actively improving the feature based on user feedback.
</Note>

## What is Chat History Memory?

Chat History Memory is a powerful feature that enables MemoryPlugin to remember **everything** you've ever discussed with your AI tools, across multiple supported platforms.

Unlike Regular Memory, which stores small snippets of information like your name, preferences, and project details, Chat History Memory preserves your complete conversation history‚Äîevery question asked, every answer received, every decision made.

### The Difference

Think of it this way:
- **Regular Memory** is like a rulebook your AI always refers to
- **Chat History Memory** is like your AI having perfect recall of every conversation you've ever had

Regular Memory continues to be important for information that should always be available. Chat History Memory complements it by providing deep historical context.

<Info>
Regular Memory and Chat History Memory work together to give your AI both instant access to key facts and long-term conversational memory.
</Info>

## Why It Matters

Your chat history might span months or years, containing:
- Countless conversations and discussions
- Shared information and context
- Projects discussed and evolved
- Decisions made and rationale
- Progress tracked over time
- Learning and insights gained

This wealth of information is too vast for Regular Memory, but it provides invaluable context that helps AI tools become more:
- **Personalized**: Understanding your communication style and preferences
- **Relevant**: Drawing on past conversations for better context
- **Helpful**: Building on previous discussions instead of starting from scratch

The difference is like talking to a doctor who only has a few notes about you versus a close friend who remembers years of conversations.

## How It Works

Chat History Memory operates in three stages:

### 1. Upload
Export your chat history from supported platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind) and upload the JSON file to MemoryPlugin.

### 2. Process
MemoryPlugin processes your chats, creating semantic embeddings that enable intelligent search and retrieval. You can configure:
- Chunking strategies (single-turn or cross-message)
- Processing order (file order, latest first, oldest first)
- Processing limits

### 3. Retrieve
When you chat with AI platforms using our Browser Extension or MCP Server, MemoryPlugin:
- Analyzes your current conversation
- Finds relevant past discussions
- Injects appropriate context automatically
- Enables powerful search and Q&A over your history

<Note>
Your chats are **never** uploaded without your explicit permission. This feature is completely opt-in.
</Note>

## Privacy and Security

Your chat history can contain sensitive information. We take our responsibility to protect your privacy seriously.

### Search Tab

Perform powerful semantic search across all your chat history.

**How to Search:**
1. Enter a natural language query (e.g., "discussions about authentication")
2. Apply optional filters:
   - Provider (ChatGPT, Claude, TypingMind, or All)
   - Date range
3. Configure context window size (1-30 chunks)
4. Enable/disable reranking for relevance optimization
5. View results with surrounding context

**Search Features:**
- **Natural language queries**: No boolean operators needed‚Äîjust ask naturally
- **Semantic understanding**: Finds conceptually related content, not just keyword matches
- **Context windows**: See messages before and after the matched content
- **Relevance ranking**: Results sorted by relevance to your query
- **Provider filtering**: Search across all platforms or filter by specific source
- **Conversation metadata**: See title, date, and message count for each result

**Search Tips:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific but Natural" icon="message-question">
    ‚úÖ "discussions about implementing JWT authentication"

    ‚ùå "auth AND jwt OR security"

    Use natural language‚Äîthe system understands context better than boolean operators.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Time Filters" icon="calendar">
    Narrow down results by date range if you remember roughly when a conversation happened.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust Context Window" icon="window">
    - Small window (1-5): Precise matches
    - Medium window (6-15): Balanced context
    - Large window (16-30): Maximum surrounding context
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Try Different Phrasings" icon="rotate">
    If you don't find what you're looking for, try rephrasing your query. Semantic search understands multiple ways of asking the same thing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Ask Tab

Ask natural language questions and get AI-powered answers synthesized from your entire chat history.

**How It Works:**
1. Enter a question about your chat history
2. The AI searches and analyzes relevant conversations
3. Receive a comprehensive answer with citations
4. Follow up with related questions

**Capabilities:**
- **Multi-step reasoning**: The AI can perform up to 10 reasoning steps, searching multiple times if needed
- **Comprehensive synthesis**: Answers typically 500+ words with detailed analysis
- **Source citations**: Every answer includes references to specific conversations
- **Tool-assisted search**: The AI can search by keywords, topics, timeframes, and more
- **Context-aware**: Understands your question and retrieves the most relevant information

**Example Questions:**
- "What have I discussed about authentication strategies?"
- "Show me all conversations about the UserProfile component"
- "What decisions did I make about database architecture?"
- "Summarize my discussions about API design patterns"
- "What feedback did I receive on my pricing page redesign?"

**Understanding Results:**

Each answer includes:
- **Synthesized response**: Comprehensive answer drawing from multiple sources
- **Citations**: References to specific conversations where information was found
- **Context snippets**: Relevant excerpts from cited conversations
- **Confidence indicators**: How certain the AI is about the answer

<Warning>
The Ask feature uses OpenAI's GPT model and can take 30-120 seconds for complex queries. Be patient while it searches and analyzes your history.
</Warning>

## Browser Extension Integration

The Browser Extension automatically injects relevant chat history context into your new conversations.

### How Auto-Injection Works

1. **Detection**: The extension detects when you're starting a new chat
2. **Analysis**: Your current prompt is analyzed for context
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant past conversations are found
4. **Injection**: Context is intelligently inserted before your prompt
5. **Seamless**: You see your prompt with enhanced context

### Configuring Injection

**Token Limits:**
- Default: 600 tokens
- Maximum: 2,000 tokens
- Configurable in extension settings

**Platform Support:**
- ‚úÖ ChatGPT
- ‚úÖ Claude (web and desktop via MCP)
- ‚úÖ Gemini
- More platforms coming soon

**Injection Modes:**
- **Single-turn**: Injects per-message chunks
- **Cross-turn**: Injects multi-message conversation context

### When Context Is Injected

Context injection happens when:
- ‚úÖ You start a new conversation
- ‚úÖ Your prompt matches relevant past discussions
- ‚úÖ Injection is enabled in settings
- ‚ùå You explicitly disable it for a conversation

<Info>
The extension shows a **Quick Inject** button or **MemoryPlugin button** near the chat input. Click once per chat to enable memory and chat history features.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Organizing Chat History

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin Your Most Important Conversations" icon="star">
    Use pinning to keep frequently referenced conversations easily accessible. Great for:
    - Project reference conversations
    - Key decision-making discussions
    - Comprehensive tutorials or learning sessions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exclude Sensitive or Irrelevant Chats" icon="filter">
    Use exclusion (not deletion) for:
    - Personal conversations you want to keep but not search
    - Experimental chats that aren't useful for context
    - Sensitive topics that shouldn't appear in injection

    Exclusion keeps the chat stored but removes it from search and injection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Cleanup" icon="broom">
    Periodically review your chat history:
    - Delete test conversations
    - Exclude outdated discussions
    - Re-organize pinned conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Search Queries" icon="magnifying-glass">
    When searching, be specific:
    - ‚úÖ "authentication implementation with JWT"
    - ‚ùå "auth stuff"

    The more descriptive your query, the better the results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Optimizing Performance

**Token Budget Management:**
- Start with default 600 tokens for injection
- Increase to 1,000-2,000 only if needed
- Remember: More tokens = more cost and slower responses

**File Upload Tips:**
- Keep files under 100 MB when possible
- Use processing limits for testing
- Process older conversations in batches

**Search Optimization:**
- Use date filters to narrow results
- Start with smaller context windows
- Enable reranking for better relevance (at cost of speed)

## Limitations and Considerations

### File Sizes
- **Maximum**: 500 MB per file
- **Recommended**: Under 100 MB for best performance
