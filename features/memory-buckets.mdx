Memory Buckets are an organizational system that lets you group related memories together into separate, isolated collections. Think of them as folders for your memories.

## What are Memory Buckets?

Buckets let you organize your memories into completely separate contexts. Each bucket is isolated from others, so your work memories stay separate from personal ones, and project-specific information doesn't mix with general notes.

**Perfect for organizing by:**
- **Context**: Personal vs. Work vs. Hobbies
- **Projects**: Different client work or personal projects
- **Topics**: Learning materials, research, creative ideas
- **Time periods**: Quarterly goals, event planning

<Info>
Every account starts with a **"General"** bucket where all memories go by default. This bucket cannot be deleted, ensuring you always have a place for new memories.
</Info>

## Creating a New Bucket

Creating buckets is straightforward:

1. **Open your [MemoryPlugin Dashboard](https://memoryplugin.com/dashboard)**
2. **Click the "New" button**
3. **Give your bucket a descriptive name**
4. **Click "Create" and you're done!**

<Note>
**Naming requirements**: Bucket names cannot be numbers alone (like "123"). You can include numbers in your bucket name, but it needs other characters too (like "Project 123" or "Q1 Goals").
</Note>

## Using Buckets

### With Browser Extension
When using the browser extension, you can switch between buckets using the MemoryPlugin interface. Click the MemoryPlugin button to see your buckets and select which one to use for the current conversation.

### With MCP Server
Specify which bucket to load memories from in your MCP client configuration or during conversations by asking the AI to load memories from a specific bucket.

### With Custom GPT
You can ask the MemoryPlugin Custom GPT to load memories from a specific bucket: "Load memories from my Work bucket"

## Are there any limits on the number of Buckets I can create?

For most users, there are virtually no limits to the number of Buckets you can create. You can create dozens and hundreds of Buckets without any issues.

If you want to create more than that, please reach out to us from our website.

## Managing Buckets

### Viewing Buckets
All your buckets are visible in the MemoryPlugin Dashboard where you can:
- See bucket names and memory counts
- Access memories within each bucket
- Switch between buckets easily

### Moving Memories
You can move memories between buckets using:
- The dashboard interface
- [Bulk operations](/features/bulk-operations) for multiple memories
- API calls for programmatic management

### Deleting Buckets
You can delete buckets you no longer need, with these restrictions:
- The "General" bucket cannot be deleted
- Deleting a bucket will also delete all memories within it
- This action cannot be undone, so be careful!

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming Convention">
    Use clear, descriptive names that will make sense to you months later. Consider using prefixes like "Project-", "Client-", or "Personal-" for consistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bucket Strategy">
    Plan your bucket structure before creating many memories. Consider how you work and what contexts you need to keep separate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Review">
    Periodically review your buckets and memories to ensure they're still organized in a way that serves your needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team Coordination">
    If you're planning to use team features, coordinate bucket naming and organization with your team members.
